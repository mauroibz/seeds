# Implementation Roadmap

**Plan revision:** 12
**Delivery rule:** one sprint must leave a demonstrably usable or risk-reducing increment, green quality gates, updated documentation, and a clean worktree.
**Active sprint:** [Sprint 030](030-entry-depth.md)

## Shape of the plan

Sprints 001–018 delivered v1 as a single dependency chain, each sprint depending on the one before
it. That chain is closed. Its contracts live in the individual sprint files linked below, which are
the source of truth for what each one promised and what it delivered; they are not restated here.

Post-v1 work branches:

                                 └─ 031 Per-domain imports   ← the plan ends here
```

**The plan stops at 031, and that is the point (DEC-058, extended by DEC-065 and DEC-071).** Sprint 025 asked whether a second domain
was affordable and answered yes. Proving the same thing twice more with games and series would spend
the remaining sprints on confirmation rather than on finishing anything, so this line now finishes
music, polishes the screen the owner actually uses, and then builds the contract that makes a third
domain an **epic on top of it** — one that can be developed in parallel with others and without
touching the core. Games and series are named under [Future epics](#future-epics-after-this-plan)
and carry no sprint number.

020 precedes the domain work because its Phase A settles how a candidate record is verified before
its fields are merged, and that is the provider contract every later domain inherits. 022 precedes
it because the fix generalizes from author to creator, and N domains should not inherit a broken
sort projection. 021 and 023 are independent of the domain line and may be reordered freely against
each other.

**GATED** marks a sprint whose first phase decides whether its second phase happens. Phase A
measures and produces a written verdict in `docs/decisions.md`, changing nothing user-visible;
Phase B builds only what that verdict and an explicit owner go-ahead justify. Phase A concluding
*no* is a complete, correct outcome. This is the owner's preferred shape for any item large enough
that its cost is unknown — see DEC-035 and DEC-042.

## Contracts for planned sprints

These are binding outcome boundaries. Before a planned sprint becomes active, the closing agent for
the prior sprint must expand it into a dedicated `docs/sprints/NNN-*.md` file using `TEMPLATE.md`,
incorporating actual deviations. Sprints 019 through 030 have files; 031 does not.

### [Sprint 019 — Post-v1 polish and ledger clearing](019-post-v1-polish.md)

Three small user-visible defects that survived v1: the score chip reads as colour-on-dark instead
of a filled chip, `s` does nothing on `/triage` despite product spec section 7, and a committed
import lands rows `unsorted` where the default library hides them, so it looks as though nothing
happened. Deliberately small and independent of everything after it.

### [Sprint 020 — Metadata completeness: viability, then build](020-metadata-completeness.md)

**Gated.** DEC-035 records that the owner wants richer metadata built up from whichever provider
has the missing piece, and specifically the ability to choose a cover from the editions actually
fetched — and that what was *not* decided is whether it is affordable. Phase A measures provider
rate limits, wall-clock import cost, whether a candidate can be verified as the same edition before
merging, disk cost of multiple cover candidates, failure semantics, and whether DEC-008's
fill-empty-only invariant survives. Phase A may conclude a narrow slice — cover choice alone, on
demand — carries most of the value at a fraction of the risk.

One item does not wait on the gate: `GoogleBooksProvider.fetch_by_isbn` takes the first hit of an
`isbn:` search, which is not guaranteed to carry the requested ISBN13. That is a live defect and is
repaired whatever the verdict.

This sprint sets the provider contract Sprint 025 inherits, so its reasoning matters as much as its
verdict.

[Closed 2026-08-13. **Phase A concluded against building**: cross-provider completion buys a
description in 22% of cases and 0% for cover, year, publisher and authors, while breaching the
Google free tier on a large import. The edition defect and the placeholder cover were both repaired.
**Phase B was then authorized by the owner (DEC-045)** and the sprint reopened to build it:
cover choice from Open Library work-record candidates, which cost no extra requests, plus a
provider-agnostic daily quota guard. Provider order stays Open Library first, measured rather than
assumed. Both shipped; the walkthrough found five defects the suite could not, including a
correction to DEC-044's placeholder rule. See DEC-044 and DEC-045.]

### [Sprint 021 — Attachments: viability, then a narrow slice](021-attachments.md)

**Gated.** The owner wants to attach arbitrary files to an entry — epubs for books — while keeping
the metadata-first framing. The scope risk is real and has a precise boundary: **an attachment is
an opaque file, or it is a reader.** Everything that expands this feature past its usefulness
follows from crossing that line.

Phase A must answer:

- **Backup.** `ARCHIVED_DIRECTORIES = ("covers", "imports")` in `backend/src/book_tracker/backup.py`
  tars everything into every backup. Covers are ~50 KB; an epub is 1–5 MB and a comic or audiobook
  far more. Seven nightly backups against a few hundred attached files is a different machine's
  worth of disk. Either attachments go in the tar under a size cap, or they are excluded with a
  documented separate story. **This is the decision that scopes the feature.**
- **Where it hangs.** Item or entry. An epub is a property of the edition; an annotated personal
  copy is a property of your entry. Item is the default and matches the metadata-first framing.
- **Serving.** Covers go through a validated pipeline with a host allowlist and a pixel bound. An
  arbitrary blob has no such thing, so size limits, content-type handling, and
  `Content-Disposition: attachment` are required rather than optional.

Phase B narrow slice, if justified: one or more opaque files per item, uploaded manually,
size-capped, listed with filename and size, downloadable from the detail page. **No format parsing,
no in-browser reader, no reading progress, no device sync.**

Reading an uploaded epub's OPF as another metadata provider filling empty fields under DEC-008 is
genuinely cheap and on-brand, and is named here so it is recognized as the natural next step rather
than smuggled into the first slice. It is explicit non-scope for Phase B.

### [Sprint 022 — Attachment lifecycle](022-attachment-lifecycle.md)

Sprint 021 shipped the storage design and the happy path. A review of what it left found the flows
around a file are thinner than the storage under it, and one genuine hole.

**The hole is reclamation.** `delete_blob_if_unreferenced` has exactly one caller, so a blob can end
up with nothing pointing at it and no way to find it — via the `CASCADE` on item delete, via a crash
between writing a blob and inserting its row, or via an item orphaned by entry deletion. At 2.5 MB a
file this is a different problem from the 39 KB orphaned cover the product spec waved through.

The rest is smaller: no rename, though the filename is already only metadata; no confirmation on
remove, though the product spec says deletes confirm and *Delete entry* on the same page does; and
upload and download both hold the whole file in memory, up to 25 MiB per request.

**No new feature surface.** An attachment stays an opaque file. Multiple selection, drag-and-drop and
progress bars are named as non-scope: real improvements, but polish rather than correctness.

**Delivered** (DEC-050). `akasha-attachments reclaim`, dry-run by default. Rename, inline. A
confirmation on remove. Streaming both ways, measured at +29.9 → +2.6 MiB peak RSS on a 25 MiB
upload. Replace was put to the owner and deliberately not built: with rename in place it is remove
plus attach. The orphaned *cover* is still not collected — the reclaim is scoped to the attachment
store on purpose, since a cover is cache the application can re-fetch.

### [Sprint 023 — Creator sort names](023-creator-sort-names.md) — completed

Delivered as planned (DEC-051): `creator_sort_override` is the owner's value, `creator_sort` and
`creator_sort_normalized` are derived from it or from a heuristic by the DEC-036 mapper event, and
migration `0011_creator_sort_names` backfilled every row.

Two things later sprints inherit. **Ordering moved to the creator column but search did not** —
the `q` filter still reads `sort_author_normalized`, because a reader types the name as written.
And **Calibre's `authors.sort` seeds the override as owner data**, which is what makes the
heuristic's known failure ("Jorge Luis Borges" → "Luis Borges, Jorge", 2 of 16 items on the
walkthrough library) survivable rather than a defect to tune out.

`sort_author` deliberately kept its name and its display role; the rename waits for Sprint 025,
which changes the metadata key from `authors` to `creators` and can do both in one pass.

### [Sprint 024 — Export](024-export.md) — completed

`GET /api/export` dumping entries and items as JSON, plus a Goodreads-shaped CSV. Product spec
section 9 deferred this to v2 as agreed-in-principle; the owner has now scheduled it. Backups
(DEC-039, DEC-040) removed the urgency, but the repository is public and portability is now a
user-facing story rather than only the owner's.

**Sprint 021 left this one question to answer** (DEC-048): whether an export carries attachment
bytes, references, or neither. Bytes make an export a multi-gigabyte archive rather than a file;
references make it portable but incomplete. Decide it explicitly rather than by omission.

Sprint 022 narrows it slightly: the filename is now **owner-edited data**, not something derivable
from the uploaded file, so whichever of the three an export carries, it has to carry the name. An
export that reconstructs names from digests loses a correction the owner made by hand (DEC-050).

Sprint 023 adds a second field of that kind: `creator_sort_override` (DEC-051). It is not derivable
from `metadata.authors` — that is the entire reason it exists — so an export that omits it loses a
correction in exactly the same way. `creator_sort` and `creator_sort_normalized` are derived and
should **not** be exported; they rebuild themselves on import.

One design constraint, because it decides whether this survives the domain work: **export the
entity shape — `type`, identifiers, and an opaque `metadata` object — not a book-specific schema.**
The database is already shaped that way. A book-shaped export format would need a v2 the moment
Sprint 025 lands.

The Goodreads-shaped CSV is a book-only convenience and is allowed to stay book-only.

[Closed 2026-08-14. Delivered as planned. **Attachments are carried as references plus their sha256,
not bytes (DEC-054)** — the blob is already held live and in every nightly backup, and a digest
resolves against a backup because the blob's path *is* its digest, verified by matching the exported
digest against the file on disk. "Neither" was never available: the sprint's own first criterion
requires the owner-typed filename to survive. Streaming needed two repairs the memory measurement
caught and the functional tests could not see — mapped entities held the whole library in the
`Session` identity map, and `yield_per` did not help because SQLite materializes the result anyway.
Measured at x1.07 (JSON) and x1.66 (CSV) peak for x10 output. The CSV neutralizes leading `=` so a
spreadsheet reads a note as text, which makes the JSON the lossless artifact. **There is no export
button in the UI** — the route is the surface, and no screen in product spec 7 asks for one.]

### [Sprint 025 — Second domain, albums: the six seams](025-second-domain-albums.md)

**No longer gated, and no longer a blind pilot.** DEC-052 accepted
`docs/domain-architecture-proposal.md`, which answered by measurement what this sprint's Phase A was
going to answer by walking: the album mapping was validated against live MusicBrainz and Cover Art
Archive responses on 2026-08-14. The gate's purpose — do not build an abstraction whose cost is
unknown — is served better by six named seams that can each be proved wrong than by an unstructured
verdict at the end.

**The core is already neutral.** `items` has been `type`/`title`/`subtitle`/`year`/`cover_path`/
`identifiers`/opaque `metadata` since Sprint 002. What is book-shaped is every layer above it, so
the work is lifting book logic out of the shared layers into a per-domain plugin. Albums are never
translated into book vocabulary.

Two measured facts rejected the tempting shortcut of casting albums into book fields:

- **MusicBrainz ships a curated sort name and only inverts people.** `Miles Davis` is a `Person` and
  sorts `Davis, Miles`; `Daft Punk` is a `Group` and does not invert. DEC-051's heuristic assumes a
  person's name and would produce `Punk, Daft`. Seam 1 generalizes the Calibre seed instead: a
  source that knows the sort name seeds the override, and the heuristic runs only when nothing knew.
- **Barcode is not a unique edition key** — one barcode was observed on three distinct releases —
  so cross-provider identity does not exist for albums. Seam 2 is therefore a strategy
  (`identity_key() -> str | None`, `None` meaning never merge), not a configurable identifier field.

Seams 1–4, 5a and 6 land here; **seam 5b is Sprint 026**. The split answers the owner's objection
that six seams is too much for one sprint, and it cuts in the only place that survives cutting:
extracting seams *before* albums would design the abstraction from one domain, which is the failure
mode the whole approach exists to avoid.

The largest blast radius is the `metadata.authors` → `creators` and `sort_author` renames DEC-051
deferred to here: 55 occurrences across 27 files, seven e2e specs, a migration and the benchmark.

[Closed 2026-08-14 on a branch (DEC-053). All six seams landed where section 4 put them and **none of
the three tripwires fired** — keyset pagination, the job runner and the ledger needed no change, and
no seventh seam appeared (DEC-055). `Daft Punk` sorts under D because MusicBrainz's curated
`sort-name` seeds the override and the DEC-051 heuristic never runs. Two seams reached slightly
further than written: the https upgrade has to apply to **every** redirect hop, because the Cover Art
Archive answers `http://` on all of them, and the field spec reaches the export — the walkthrough
caught the Goodreads CSV emitting albums as books. The API also stopped inventing empty metadata
defaults (DEC-056).]

### [Sprint 026 — Statuses, formats and tracklists](026-statuses-formats-tracklists.md)

**Music, finished as a domain.** Sprint 025 shipped albums carrying books' status *values* under
album *labels* — honest, visible, and a one-sprint debt. This clears it and adds the two things the
owner found missing once albums were real.

Three decisions arrive with it, all already made, none needing re-litigation:

- **DEC-057** — an album's status records **possession**, not consumption: `wishlist` / `pending` /
  `owned`, with no relisten counter and no started/finished dates. That makes status a per-domain
  *concept* rather than a per-domain vocabulary, which is what seam 5b was always for.
- **DEC-059** — **format is an independent axis on the entry**: multi-valued, per-domain vocabulary,
  and legal on any status, so "wishlist → vinyl" is expressible and "sort by owned, see how" is one
  filter plus a card. It reuses shelves' machinery and none of shelves' meaning — shelves stay the
  higher tier ("work", "fiction").
- **Tracklists**, measured at one `inc=recordings` parameter and no extra request. They need the
  first field type the spec cannot yet describe: an ordered list of structured rows. Tracks are
  metadata, **not** child entities.

The sprint's own risk note names the tracklist slice as the one to defer to 027 if it runs long,
rather than the one to rush.

### [Sprint 027 — Library shell and shelves](027-library-shell-and-shelves.md)

The polish pass on the screen the owner spends their time in, scheduled by DEC-058 as the last
feature work before the contract sprints. Three findings from the Sprint 025 walkthrough, all in the
"Owner feedback" section below with their causes already traced:

- **A domain tab selector.** Sprint 025 deliberately left the list endpoint with no `type` filter,
  because AC4 only required that a mixed library paginate correctly — which it must either way. This
  is the other half: books and albums together read as a mixed bag rather than as one library. The
  tab strip is fed by `GET /api/item-types`, which already serves the domains and their labels; the
  open question is only what the default is.
- **The library grid is a fixed-height window inside the page** (`h-[min(70vh,760px)]` on the
  virtualizer's scroll container), so the primary surface scrolls inside a box. Letting the page
  scroll and having the virtualizer measure the window is the fix, and it is the one thing Sprint 013
  was called in to repair — so it re-runs the scale and feed-semantics checks rather than assuming
  them.
- **Shelves are edited from a dialog named after something else.** Shelf membership lives inside
  `OpinionDialog`, and creating a shelf is a whole route. The API already does what is needed, so
  this is UI-shaped: inline shelf editing with create-on-type. DEC-059 fixed the boundary this must
  respect — shelves are the higher tier ("work", "fiction"); formats are not shelves and must not be
  rendered as one.

Sprint 026 did **not** defer its tracklist slice, so this sprint carries only the three items above.
It also inherits `facets.status_counts_by_type`, which is half of the tab strip already built.

[Closed 2026-08-15. All three delivered, plus a fourth the sprint's own baseline got wrong: **the
bulk *Add shelves* action in triage had never been built** — `add_shelves` existed on the endpoint
and was tested, but no control sent it, and product spec §7 said so. The tab default was settled
with the owner as **the last domain used** (DEC-062), which also records why `type` clears the
status facets but applies to `format_counts`. The library now virtualizes against the window;
Sprint 013's scale and feed-semantics checks were re-run against that rather than assumed. Ran on
`sprint-025-albums` per DEC-063.

**Reopened the same day** at the owner's request to fold in the add flow, which is the same
complaint one screen over: the confirm screen showed three of the fields the search had already
returned and discarded the rest. It now shows all of them for free and fetches the full record on a
button (DEC-064), shelves and the whole opinion can be set while adding, and one shared control per
concept replaced two rows of checkboxes.]

### [Sprint 028 — The domain contract](028-the-domain-contract.md)

**Gated**, and the first of the two sprints DEC-058 makes the gate to further domains.

Albums proved the seams exist. What does not exist yet is a **written contract**: a new domain is
currently built by reading how albums were built and inferring the rules. Phase A produces that
contract — what a domain must supply (`Domain` and its registry entry, an adapter, a field spec, a
status vocabulary, a format vocabulary, a URL recognizer), what it may never touch, and where its
code lives — plus **a conformance suite a domain must pass**, run against books and albums first to
prove it describes reality rather than intentions.

Phase A also measures what is still misplaced: book-shaped logic sitting in shared layers that two
domains happened not to collide over. Phase B moves only what the suite proves is misplaced.

**The baseline was re-derived on 2026-08-15 and sharpened the sprint.** A domain is not yet a unit of
code: adding a third one edits nine shared files, two of them badly. `entries.ck_entries_status`
holds a status list frozen at migration-write time, so a domain declaring a status books and albums
lack is accepted by the API and refused by SQLite — **a new domain currently needs a migration on a
shared table.** And enrichment is book-shaped below its seam (`_backfillable_items` joins on ISBN),
which albums never tested because they declare `enriches=False`. The owner settled two things at
planning time: that constraint is measured and costed here rather than pre-authorized, and **the
contract prescribes a per-domain code home, with books and albums moved into it in Phase B** as the
proof that the layout exists.

**This is where DEC-052's falsifiable prediction gets tested properly.** "Games need no seam albums
did not" is checked by writing the conformance suite against the seams and seeing whether a paper
walk through IGDB passes it — which is cheaper and more honest than another bespoke sprint.

[Closed 2026-08-15. **Both phases ran.** Phase A wrote the contract (technical spec 6.6), the
conformance suite (`test_domain_conformance.py`, parametrized over `DOMAINS`), the costed measurement
(DEC-067, four of ten rows recommending no work) and the IGDB paper walk (DEC-068: **no seventh
seam**, but the first adapter needing mutable state and a secret pair, and six shared files plus one
alembic head that two parallel domain teams would contend over). The suite found a live defect on its
first run — `urlsplit` raises on `http://[`, and one domain's raising recognizer denied every domain
after it its turn. **The owner authorized all four Phase B items** (DEC-069): per-domain packages,
`provider_health` read from the registry, the cover chooser declared per domain, and migration `0014`
dropping `ck_entries_status`. The move itself exposed three more shared things quietly shaped like
books, all repaired. **A third domain now costs its own package, one registry entry, provider wiring,
three enum lines, and no migration.** Reopened once more for the documentation pass (DEC-070):
`docs/guides/adding-a-domain.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `docs/README.md`, with the guide proved by
building a throwaway third domain from it — which found three closed-world assumptions and removed
them.]

### [Sprint 029 — One search bar](029-one-search-bar.md)

Accepted as DEC-065 and scoped in `docs/unified-search-proposal.md`. `/` is rebuilt around a single
bar that searches the library and adds to it, with the domain selector beside it and **"All" removed
as a filter**, so the tab strip always names exactly one domain. The full description, including the
owner's two amendments, is under *Scheduled from owner feedback* below.

It runs after 028 because it is the sprint most likely to amend the contract's account of what a
*screen* renders from the registry. **Narrowed 2026-08-16:** this paragraph originally said the
backend contract and the conformance suite were untouched by it, which was written before DEC-071
added copy neutrality as the sprint's sixth deliverable. That deliverable may add **one declarative
field** to `Domain` for a per-domain search placeholder, with the conformance check such a field
requires. The invariant that holds either way is the one that matters: no shared layer branches on
which domain it is holding.

**Delivered 2026-08-16, closed 2026-08-17 (DEC-073), and the narrowing is narrowed back:** the field
was authorized and **not taken**. One neutral placeholder naming title, creator, ISBN and link serves
every domain, so the backend contract and the conformance suite are untouched after all, as this
paragraph first claimed. What the sprint did change is the account of the *screen*: `/` is now where
you search and add, `/add` is manual entry, results render below the library rather than above it,
and a provider is reached only on settled-and-empty or on **Add** — a rule verified by counting
requests. The full Outcome is in the sprint file.

**Reopened for a second pass, 2026-08-17 (DEC-074)**, on the owner's report after using it: the
confirm step gives a `long_text` field both columns, the bar clears in one press, an active query
that misses gets one line instead of the tall empty state, the status chips fold into a fourth
filter beside sort/shelf/format, and Files becomes its own region on the detail page. Five frontend
changes, no API and no schema.

### [Sprint 030 — Entry depth: the decision](030-entry-depth.md)

**Gated, and Phase A only by design.** Scheduled by DEC-071 after the Sprint 028 assessment
(`docs/domain-expansion-assessment.md`) named it as the **one thing on the whole list that could
force a redesign rather than an extension**. Everything else the assessment found — sorting, search,
facets, field types, manual entry, chrome copy, attachments — is additive and can wait for a real
domain to ask. This cannot: an entry is flat, and hierarchy reaches the entry model, keyset
pagination and its cursor, triage selection, bulk operations, every facet count and the library row.

**It runs before per-domain imports and before any third domain**, because a domain built against
the wrong answer is the expensive mistake, and the answer costs half a sprint.

**The owner's hypothesis, to be tested rather than assumed** (DEC-071):

> Most scenarios can be modelled by going **one level down only** — series into seasons, books into
> chapters if any, albums into songs, at most. And the depth available is decided by **how the
> provider stores it**: if a TV provider returns one entry per season, no finer grain exists to
> model. In the other direction, items can be **grouped into sets** — the individual Harry Potter
> books as one set — and a set may be useful for things other than depth.

**One precedent already exists and Phase A must start from it.** A tracklist is one level down, and
it is modelled as **metadata rows on the item, not as entities** (Sprint 026, DEC-057). It works, it
cost one `inc=recordings` parameter, and nothing hangs off a track. So the question is not "can we
represent children" — we can, today. The question is narrower and sharper:

**Does a child need state of its own?** A tracklist is read-only display. *"Watched through season 3,
episode 7"* is a status on a child. That difference is the whole sprint.

Phase A must produce a written verdict answering, with evidence:

1. **What the providers actually return** — TMDB seasons and episodes, IGDB DLC and editions,
   MusicBrainz recordings — measured against the live APIs the way DEC-052 was, not reasoned about.
2. **Which of three shapes wins**, costed as a table: (a) a per-domain `progress` field on the
   existing flat entry; (b) `rows` metadata plus a progress marker into it; (c) real child entities
   with their own status. And what each costs in pagination, triage, bulk operations, counts,
   export, the import ledger and undo.
3. **Whether "a set" is the same concept as depth or a different one**, since the owner names it as
   possibly useful for other fields. A set that groups items across a domain is not a parent entity.

   **This question is already open in the spec and the two must be answered together.** Product spec
   section 11 item 4 adopts a default — *series is free text in `metadata`, not modelled* — and names
   its own breaking point: *"show me the Malazan books in reading order"*, which needs a real series
   and position pair. DEC-058 flagged the vocabulary collision separately. The owner's Harry Potter
   set and the spec's Malazan series are the same feature asked for twice, four months apart, and
   Phase A answers them once or leaves both open honestly.
4. **What the cheapest thing that satisfies a real user sentence is** — "I'm on season 3" — because
   the assessment's own warning applies here: designing depth from zero serial domains is the
   Strategy-B failure DEC-052 rejected on evidence.

**Phase A concluding "flat, with a per-domain progress field" is a complete and correct outcome**,
and on current evidence the likeliest one. Phase B, if it happens at all, is authorized separately.

### Sprint 031 — Per-domain imports

The last sprint in the plan. Import is book-only today. Sprint 028 moved the two readers into the
domain they serve — `domains/book/goodreads.py` and `domains/book/calibre.py` — so what remains
book-shaped is the layer *above* them: `application/imports.py` and `api/imports.py` assume books
throughout, while the ledger, the preview and undo are genuinely shared and must stay that way. The
boundary this sprint draws is therefore between the shared pipeline and importers that already live
in the right place (DEC-069).

The outcome is a pipeline where `calibre → books` is one importer among several rather than the
shape of importing itself, so that `spotify → music` and `steam → games` are **epics somebody else
can build in parallel** without touching the core (DEC-058). Calibre and Goodreads are re-expressed
against that boundary; no second importer is built here, because building one would be the epic this
sprint exists to make possible.

When this closes, the project state goes `complete` per `WORKFLOW.md`'s final-sprint rule.

## Future epics, after this plan

Not sprints, and deliberately not numbered (DEC-058). Each becomes an epic on top of Sprint 028's
contract and Sprint 031's import boundary, developed in parallel without interfering with the others.

- **Games — IGDB.** Carries DEC-052's prediction that games need no seam albums did not; Sprint 028's
  conformance suite is where that gets checked. The new infrastructure is authentication: IGDB needs
  Twitch OAuth client credentials and token refresh, where every provider so far has needed at most a
  static API key. `steam → games` is the import.
- **Series — TMDB.** Gated on a product decision rather than an integration. The entry model is one
  score, one status, one `reread_count` per item (product spec section 10, item 4), and a television
  series does not fit it: either a series is one entry and "watched through season 3" is not
  expressible, or entries gain hierarchy, which reaches keyset pagination, triage selection, bulk
  operations and every count in the UI. Note the vocabulary collision before it causes confusion —
  book-series already exists as a free-text `metadata` field, and product spec section 11 item 4
  records the deliberate choice not to model it.
- **Music imports — `spotify → music`.** The natural first exercise of Sprint 031's boundary.

## Owner feedback — recorded 2026-08-14, unscheduled

Raised while trying Sprint 025's albums in the running application. **All of it is now delivered**:
items 2 and 3 by Sprint 026, items 1, 4 and 5 by Sprint 027. The causes below were
traced when the feedback was recorded, so the sprints that pick them up start from evidence rather
than from a rediscovery. The status half became **DEC-057** and the ownership half **DEC-059**.

### 1. The library should select a domain, not mix them

**Delivered by Sprint 027.** The default was the one real question and the owner settled it: the last domain used, remembered between visits (DEC-062).

> "The main library should really have a tab selector to choose between domains, there is no point
> in showing books and albums combined."

Sprint 025 deliberately left the list endpoint with **no `type` filter** — AC4 asked only that a
mixed library paginate correctly, and it does. This is the other half of that decision, and the
walkthrough supports it: books and albums beside each other read as a mixed bag rather than as one
library.

Small, and it lands naturally beside Sprint 026's filter-chip work: a `type` parameter on
`GET /api/entries`, a tab strip fed by `GET /api/item-types` (which already serves the domain list
and labels), and a remembered choice in the URL the way every other filter already is. The one real
question is what the default is — all, or the last domain used.

### 2. Albums should carry their tracklist

> "Albums should really come with songlists as metadata."

**Measured 2026-08-14: this is one query parameter.** The release fetch already asks MusicBrainz for
`inc=artist-credits+labels+media+release-groups`; adding `recordings` returns every track's position,
title and length in the same request — 6.4 KB for *Kind of Blue*, no extra call, no extra rate-limit
budget.

Sprint 025's non-scope said "tracks as entities" belongs to Sprint 028's entry-hierarchy question,
and that still holds: a tracklist stored as **metadata** on the album is not that. It needs a field
type the spec does not have yet — an ordered list of structured rows rather than a line of text —
which is the only reason this is not already done.

### 3. Format and ownership tags

> "Maybe categories like CD/Digital/Vinyl as tags? It can transfer to books as well
> (physical/borrowed/digital)."

Cuts across domains, which is what makes it interesting and what makes it need a decision first: it
overlaps `owned` as a status. **DEC-057 states the overlap and recommends an answer**; Sprint 026
has to settle it before either is built. Note that an album's `format` already arrives from
MusicBrainz as metadata (`CD`, `12" Vinyl`) — as a *property of the release*, not as a fact about
your copy, which is a different thing wearing the same word.

### 4. The library grid is a window inside the page

**Delivered by Sprint 027.** The virtualizer measures the window; Sprint 013's scale and feed-semantics checks were re-run against the new model rather than assumed.

> "The main coverart/library scroll does not use the entire page, it's a window, even though it's
> the primary thing we are looking at."

Concrete cause: `frontend/src/features/library/VirtualLibrary.tsx` gives the scroll container
`h-[min(70vh,760px)]`, so the grid is a fixed box with its own scrollbar inside a `max-w-7xl` page
(`pages/HomePage.tsx`). The virtualizer measures that element, which is why it was written that way
— it is not decorative.

The fix is to let the **page** scroll and have the virtualizer measure the window instead, which
`@tanstack/react-virtual` supports directly. Not a large change, but it touches the one thing Sprint
013 was called in to repair, so it wants its own slice with the scale tests (10,000 entries, the
accessibility feed semantics) run against it rather than being folded into a feature sprint.

### 5. Shelves are too far from the thing being shelved

**Delivered by Sprint 027**, on the detail page and — a third friction nobody had named — in the triage bulk bar, where *Add shelves* had been specified since v1 and never built.

> "Shelves kinda suck, having to create them by going on a new screen + having to click 'edit
> opinion' to be able to change them is not ideal."

Two separate frictions, and the second is the sharper one: shelf membership lives inside
`OpinionDialog`, so putting a book on a shelf means opening a dialog named after something else.
Creating a shelf is a whole route (`/shelves`).

Both are UI-shaped rather than model-shaped — `POST /api/shelves` and the entry's `shelf_ids` already
do what is needed, and bulk shelf assignment already exists in triage. Likely shape: shelf editing
inline on the detail page and on a card, with create-on-type in the same control.

## Scheduled from owner feedback

### One search bar on `/` — adding and searching in the same place

Owner feedback, 2026-08-15, after Sprint 027's second pass: *"the main page should have both
functionalities open to the user: adding and searching for your data… 1 large searchbar up top for
both,"* with the domain selector to its left and an **Add** button to its right, a local search that
consults no provider when it hits, and a web search below when it misses.

**Scoped in `docs/unified-search-proposal.md`, accepted as DEC-065, and scheduled as
[Sprint 029](029-one-search-bar.md).** The owner amended it twice: **"All" is removed as a filter**,
so the tab strip always names exactly one domain and nothing has to ask which domain a search
means; and the confirm step becomes a dialog **on condition that no functionality is lost**, which
the sprint carries as an eleven-row inventory rather than an intention. A web search fires only once
a query has settled and returned nothing, or on the button — the literal "no local hit" rule fires
once per keystroke while typing any new title, which breaches the Google free tier DEC-044 already
measured.

**Delivered and closed 2026-08-17.** The inventory grew to thirteen rows during the sprint and all
thirteen carried over; the firing rule gained three clauses in the building and is recorded as built
in DEC-073.

## Not scheduled

- **Auth.** Product spec section 9 keeps this a v2 deferral with no sprint number, reaffirmed by the
  owner during the revision-8 re-plan. It remains the gate on any exposure beyond LAN: no public
  DNS, port-forwarding, tunnel, or internet-reachable proxy until it exists.
- **Sharing, multiuser, Calibre write-back, OPDS.** Product spec section 9, unchanged.
- **The owner feedback above**, until it is scheduled.
- **Wine and the remaining exploratory domains.** `docs/domain_metadata_roadmap_report.md` assesses
  them; none is scheduled. Wine's weakness is access economics rather than catalogue geography.

## Cross-sprint definition of done

Every sprint must:

- satisfy every acceptance criterion or remain incomplete;
- add tests at the correct layer and run focused plus regression suites;
- preserve data and security invariants;
- update OpenAPI/types/docs when contracts move;
- record material deviations in `docs/decisions.md`;
- review downstream sprint impact;
- pass `python scripts/validate_project.py`, `make check`, and `make test` when available;
- end with a clean worktree and an updated next-agent handoff.
