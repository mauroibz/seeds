# Contributing

Issues and pull requests are welcome. This file is the short version; the map of everything is
[`docs/README.md`](docs/README.md).

> **Adding a new domain** — games, films, board games, anything that is not books or albums — has its
> own guide: **[`docs/guides/adding-a-domain.md`](docs/guides/adding-a-domain.md)**. Start there
> rather than here. It exists so you never have to reverse-engineer how albums were built.

## Set up

You need Node 22, npm, and [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/). `uv` installs Python 3.12 itself.

```bash
make bootstrap
cp .env.example .env      # set USER_AGENT_CONTACT to a real address

make dev-backend          # terminal 1 — API at http://localhost:8000
make dev-frontend         # terminal 2 — UI at http://localhost:5173
```

## The gates

Run these before opening a pull request. They are strict on purpose — this project once closed
thirteen sprints green on a product that did not work, and every gate below exists because of a
specific failure that got past the ones before it (`docs/assessment.md`, DEC-025).

```bash
make check                       # format, lint, types, project state, OpenAPI drift
make test                        # 469 backend, 130 frontend
cd frontend && npm run test:e2e  # 86 browser tests, dev server and a real production build
cd .. && make smoke-container    # healthcheck, non-root, persistence, restore, graceful SIGTERM
```

`make smoke-container` is not optional theatre: it has caught failures — a broken module path inside
the image, an asset chunk that was built but never served — that no unit test, type check or browser
test could see.

## How the code is organised

```text
backend/src/book_tracker/
├── api/             # thin FastAPI routers and error mapping
├── application/     # use cases and transaction boundaries
├── domain/          # spec.py: what a domain is · registry.py: which ones exist
├── domains/         # one package per domain — book/, album/
├── infrastructure/  # SQLAlchemy, provider HTTP, covers, jobs
└── main.py          # app factory, lifespan, static SPA mount
```

The rule that matters: **the shared layers never branch on which domain they are holding.** A layer
that needs domain-specific behaviour asks the registry for a declaration. `if item_type == "book"` is
the thing to catch in review.

## Rules that are not style preferences

- **Never re-record a provider fixture to make a test pass.** `backend/tests/fixtures/providers/`
  holds pinned real API responses. Re-recording one turns a regression test into a rubber stamp
  (DEC-025).
- **A mock substituted for the unit under test does not prove that unit.** Mock the transport;
  replay a recorded response.
- **Never weaken, skip or delete a test to get green**, and never fabricate command output.
- **Imported user data is never overwritten by synchronisation.** Explicit refresh is the only
  overwrite path, and it is confirmed.
- **Migrations are the only schema-change path**, and a migration must never import the live
  registry — it is history, and history does not change when a domain is added.
- **Internal names are permanent.** The package stays `book_tracker` and the core entities stay
  `items`/`entries` regardless of product branding. User-facing copy is the only thing that follows
  the brand.
- **Passing tests are not evidence that a flow works.** Run the application against realistic data
  and use the thing you changed.

## Commits and pull requests

Conventional subjects: `feat:`, `fix:`, `test:`, `refactor:`, `build:`, `docs:`. Say what changed and
why it changed; the diff already says how.

If your change alters a contract — an API shape, a schema, a product behaviour — update the spec it
contradicts in the same pull request, and add an entry to [`docs/decisions.md`](docs/decisions.md)
explaining the choice. Decisions are append-only: supersede an old entry, never edit it.

## If you are an AI agent

Read [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) first. It is the binding protocol for sessions that change this
repository — one sprint at a time, test-driven, with a walkthrough gate and an atomic handoff — and
it overrides this file wherever the two differ.
