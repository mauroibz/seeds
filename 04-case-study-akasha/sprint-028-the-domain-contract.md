# Sprint 028 — The domain contract

**Status:** completed
**Depends on:** 027
**Roadmap revision:** 11
**Branch:** `sprint-025-albums`, continuing DEC-053/DEC-061/DEC-063. The owner settled this at
planning time: sprints 025–027 stay unmerged and 028 runs beside them, so the contract is written
against a codebase that actually holds two domains.

## Objective

**A third domain must be an epic somebody else can build in parallel — not a patch to files every
other domain lives in.**

That is the epic this sprint gates (DEC-058): each domain encapsulated enough that
`calibre → books`, `spotify → music` and `steam → games` can be built by different hands without
touching each other or the core. Sprint 025 proved the seams exist. What does not exist is a
**contract** — a new domain is currently built by reading how albums were built and inferring the
rules — and, more sharply, **a domain is not yet a unit of code**: it is a set of edits distributed
across nine shared files, one of them a migration on the `entries` table.

Phase A produces that contract, plus a conformance suite a domain must pass, plus a measurement of
what a third domain would still have to touch. Phase B moves what the measurement proves.

**Sprint 029 rebuilds the main screen right after this one** (DEC-065), so the contract's account of
what a *screen* renders from the registry is the part most likely to need revising. Write it against
the registry rather than against today's layout, and expect 029's close to amend the screen-facing
section — the backend contract and the conformance suite are unaffected by that sprint.

**Gated** (DEC-035, DEC-042): Phase A is a written verdict in `docs/decisions.md` and changes nothing
user-visible. Phase A concluding that little is misplaced is a complete, correct outcome, and Phase B
runs only on that verdict plus an explicit owner go-ahead.

This is the first of the two sprints DEC-058 makes the gate to further domains.

## Required context

1. `AGENTS.md`, `docs/agent/WORKFLOW.md`
2. `docs/decisions.md`: **DEC-052** (the six seams and the falsifiable prediction this sprint is
   here to test), **DEC-057** and **DEC-059** (what an entry is per domain), **DEC-060** (seam 5b as
   built — the single best statement of what `Domain` currently declares), **DEC-062** (the library
   shell's dependence on the registry, and the facet asymmetry the contract must state),
   DEC-058 (why the plan ends here)
3. `docs/sprints/025-second-domain-albums.md` and `026-statuses-formats-tracklists.md`, both
   Outcomes — the actual record of what a second domain cost
4. `backend/src/book_tracker/domain/domains.py` in full. `Domain` **is** the contract today, and it
   is undocumented outside the sprint files that grew it.
5. `docs/specs/technical-spec.md` sections 5.1, 7.1, 7.2, 8; `docs/specs/product-spec.md` sections
   3.2, 3.3, 7
6. `docs/agent/HANDOFF.md` and the last worklog entry

## Current implementation baseline

**Re-derived 2026-08-15 by reading the code, not the previous sprint's summary.** Re-derive again at
activation; the file references below are the ones that were true on that date.

### What is already neutral, and must not be re-litigated

- `Domain` (`domain/domains.py`) carries `item_type`, `label`, `identity`, `fields`, `enriches`,
  `recognize`, `statuses`, `default_status`, `entry_fields`, `formats`, `entry_panel_label`.
  `DOMAINS` is a dict keyed on `item_type`; `DEFAULT_DOMAIN` names books for every call site that
  predates the second domain.
- `GET /api/item-types` (`api/library.py:478`) publishes all of it, and the library shell, triage,
  detail page and status controls render from it. **There is no `type === "album"` branch anywhere.**
- Writes validate against the item's own domain in `LibraryService._validated`, refused with a 422
  naming the domain; a bulk write spanning domains is refused whole.
- **A partial conformance suite already exists**: `backend/tests/test_domain.py:140-179` parametrizes
  over `DOMAINS` and checks the status vocabulary, the hotkey bindings and the format vocabulary.
  The new suite absorbs it rather than duplicating it.
- **Three published unions** — `EntryStatus`, `EntryFormat`, `ItemTypeName` — each spelled out for
  mypy and each pinned to the registry by an assertion in `test_domain.py`. That pattern is a
  contract rule, not a coincidence.

### What a third domain must edit today — the measurement Phase A starts from

A domain is not a unit of code. Adding `game` means editing files that books and albums live in:

| Shared file | What a third domain changes there |
|---|---|
| `domain/domains.py` | its fields, statuses, formats, its `Domain`, the `DOMAINS` tuple, **all three published unions**, its URL recognizer and host regexes — all beside books' and albums' |
| `domain/providers.py` | its `IdentityStrategy` constant |
| `main.py` | provider construction and registration, **and `provider_health` (`main.py:259-270`), which names `openlibrary`/`musicbrainz`/`googlebooks` as literals** |
| `config.py` | credentials — IGDB needs Twitch OAuth, where every provider so far needed at most a static key |
| `infrastructure/covers.py:25-36` | its art host in the shared allowlist |
| `alembic/versions/` | a migration rebuilding the shared `entries` table (below) |
| `frontend/src/api/library.ts:6-24` | `entryStatuses` / `entryFormats`, hand-mirrored from the backend enums |
| `frontend/src/features/library/labels.ts` | the fallback vocabulary, which is the book vocabulary |
| `frontend/src/pages/AddPage.tsx:112,250,299` | three live `itemType === "book"` branches — search label, placeholder, manual-fallback copy |

Two of those are worse than a file to edit, and are the findings Phase A must cost:

- **`entries.ck_entries_status` is a frozen list.** `alembic/versions/0013_entry_formats.py:66`
  renders the CHECK from `ALL_STATUSES` **at migration-write time**, so the live database holds
  `('unsorted','read','reading','to_read','wishlist','dropped','pending','owned')`. A third domain
  declaring `playing` passes `validate_status` and is then refused by SQLite. **A new domain
  currently requires a schema migration on a shared table** — the sharpest contradiction of the epic
  goal in the repository. The owner's instruction is that this is measured and costed here, with
  alternatives, and decided at the gate; it is **not** pre-authorized work.
- **Enrichment is book-shaped below the seam.** `_backfillable_items`
  (`application/enrichment.py:341+`) correctly filters on `domain.enriches`, but its SQL joins
  `item_identifiers.kind = 'isbn'` and tests `publisher`/`page_count`/`description`; `PROVIDER_ORDER`
  (`enrichment.py:33`) is `("openlibrary","googlebooks")` and `_fetch` takes an ISBN. Albums only
  avoid all of this by declaring `enriches=False`, so **the second domain never tested this seam.**
  A third domain that enriches on a non-ISBN key finds nothing behind the flag.

### Known book-shaped things in shared layers, to be measured rather than assumed

- The **manual add path** (`application/add.py:129-148`) is a book form hard-wired to
  `DEFAULT_DOMAIN`: ISBN, publisher, language, and a `frontend/src/features/detail/schemas.ts`
  validator that says "A book needs a title".
- **`cover_candidates` (`application/providers.py`) takes an Open Library provider as an argument.**
  That is why "Choose a cover" appears on an album and can only say no — a defect that predates this
  sprint and has now been left unmentioned three times. **Decide it here: in scope, or scheduled.**
- The detail route is **`/books/:id` for every domain** (`VirtualLibrary.tsx:267,285`,
  `TriagePage.tsx:358,745`, `AddPage.tsx:209,631`).
- The whole **import layer is book-only** — `domain/goodreads.py`, `domain/calibre.py`,
  `application/imports.py`, and `api/imports.py` whose preview rows carry `goodreads_book_id`,
  `calibre_book_id`, `calibre_uuid` and `isbn`. That is the **per-domain imports** sprint's outcome —
  numbered 030 when this was written, renumbered **031** by DEC-071, which inserted the entry-depth
  decision ahead of it. Phase A names its cost and moves none of it.
- `domain/goodreads.py` and `domain/calibre.py` sit in `domain/` beside the shared domain model,
  which is the clearest symptom of there being no per-domain code home at all.

## Deliverables

### Phase A — the contract, the suite, the measurement

1. **A written domain contract**, in `docs/specs/technical-spec.md` and referenced from
   `docs/decisions.md`: every field of `Domain` and what supplying it obliges; the adapter, field
   spec, status vocabulary, format vocabulary, identity strategy and URL recognizer a domain must
   provide; what a domain may never touch; and — the owner's decision at planning time —
   **where its code lives, prescriptively**: a per-domain package holding all of the above, with the
   registration points that stay shared named exhaustively (`DOMAINS`, provider wiring in `main.py`,
   migrations). The layout section is a prescription, and Phase B moves books and albums into it.
2. **A conformance suite** — `backend/tests/test_domain_conformance.py` — parametrized over
   `DOMAINS`, so it runs against books and albums today and against a third domain by that domain
   existing. It absorbs `test_domain.py:140-179` rather than duplicating it, and checks at least:
   the three published unions cover this domain's values; every declared status has a label and a
   distinct triage key within its domain; `default_status` is one of the declared statuses;
   `entry_fields` is a subset of the passage fields; a field spec's `columns` is present exactly for
   `rows` fields; a metadata field never shadows a `RESERVED_FIELD_NAMES` column; the identity rule
   rejects what it should; and the API refuses this domain's non-values with a 422. Plus two the
   measurement forces:
   - **every value a domain declares is accepted by the database, not only by the API** — the check
     that fails today for a hypothetical third domain and makes the CHECK-constraint finding a test
     result rather than an opinion;
   - **the frontend's `entryStatuses` / `entryFormats` agree with the registry**, so the hand-mirrored
     TypeScript unions cannot drift the way a hand-maintained label map would.
3. **A measurement of what is misplaced, as a costed table of alternatives — not one path.** One row
   per finding: what it is, which domains it blocks, the options with their cost, and a
   recommendation. The two named findings above and the cover chooser are its minimum contents.
4. **A paper walk through IGDB against the suite**, which is where DEC-052's prediction that "games
   need no seam albums did not" is actually tested. It must also answer the question the epic asks:
   **which shared files would an IGDB team edit, and would a Spotify team editing them the same week
   collide?** That is the falsifiable form of "developed in parallel without interfering". Cheaper
   and more honest than another bespoke sprint.

### Phase B — only what the verdict justifies

5. **Move books and albums into per-domain packages**, one coherent slice per move, with the suite
   green before and after — the demonstration that the contract's layout section describes something
   that exists.
6. Move anything else the suite proves is misplaced, on the same terms.

## Acceptance criteria

1. The contract document is sufficient to build a domain without reading Sprints 025–027, and states
   where that domain's code lives.
2. The conformance suite runs against every registered domain by parametrization, not by a
   per-domain test, and both books and albums pass it.
3. The suite fails when a deliberately malformed domain is registered in a test — a status with no
   label, a `default_status` outside the vocabulary, a `rows` field with no columns, **and a status
   value the database's CHECK constraint would refuse**.
4. The measurement is a costed table with alternatives per finding, and covers the CHECK constraint,
   the enrichment key, and the cover chooser.
5. The IGDB paper walk produces a written verdict naming every seam it would and would not need, and
   the shared files two parallel domain teams would contend over.
6. Phase A changes no user-visible behavior; the full suite and the e2e gate are green and unchanged.
7. Any Phase B move leaves every existing test green without weakening one, and is a separate commit.
   The per-domain package move is either delivered or explicitly deferred with the owner's recorded
   go-ahead — not left ambiguous.

## Required tests (TDD)

- The conformance suite itself, written against books and albums before any move.
- A malformed-domain fixture, registered only inside the test, that each conformance check rejects.
- The database-acceptance check written against a fixture domain whose status the current constraint
  refuses, so the finding is reproducible rather than argued.
- For any Phase B move: the existing tests covering the moved behavior run unchanged against its new
  home before the old one is deleted.

## Verification

```bash
python scripts/validate_project.py
make format && make check && make test
cd frontend && npm run test:e2e
cd .. && make build && make smoke-container
git diff --check
```

Phase A is documentation and tests, so the walkthrough gate is satisfied by demonstrating that the
suite fails against a malformed domain and passes against both real ones. **Phase B's package move
re-arms the full walkthrough gate** against a library holding books and albums: nothing user-visible
should change, and that has to be seen rather than asserted.

## Explicit non-scope

- **Building a third domain.** That is an epic on top of this contract (DEC-058), and building one
  here would be the thing this sprint exists to make unnecessary.
- **Per-domain imports.** Sprint 031 (030 when this was written; DEC-071 inserted entry depth ahead
  of it). Phase A *names* the book-shaped import layer as misplaced and costs it; moving it is that
  sprint's whole outcome.
- **The one search bar.** Sprint 029 (DEC-065).
- **A plugin runtime.** Product spec section 2 has held the line since v1: the registry is code.
- Re-opening DEC-057, DEC-059 or DEC-062.

## Commit checkpoints

1. `test: hold every domain to the same contract` (the suite, against books and albums)
2. `docs: state what a domain must supply` (the contract, plus the IGDB verdict as a decision)
3. Phase B only, one per move, e.g. `refactor: give each domain its own package`
4. final `docs(sprint-028): close sprint and hand off`

## Risks and decisions to surface

- **The gate is real.** Phase A concluding that almost nothing is misplaced is a correct outcome and
  must be reported as one, not padded into a refactor to justify the sprint. The measurement above
  makes that unlikely, which is a reason to trust the measurement rather than to widen the sprint.
- **A conformance suite that only restates the dataclass is worthless.** It has to be able to fail:
  the malformed-domain fixture is the acceptance criterion that keeps it honest.
- **Scope creep runs through "while we are here".** Every move Phase B makes must be one the suite
  or the measurement proved, not one the reader noticed.
- **The per-domain package move touches import paths across the backend and is the largest thing in
  this sprint.** If it runs long, it is the slice to hand to the first domain epic with the contract
  already written — not the slice to rush. Say so in the handoff rather than half-finishing it.
- The cover chooser on an album is a real defect and predates this sprint. Decide whether it is in
  scope or scheduled, rather than leaving it unmentioned a fourth time.

## Outcome

### Phase A — delivered 2026-08-15, awaiting the Phase B gate

**Commits:** `4cb28f8` (re-derived baseline, DEC-066), `afbf5ff` (the conformance suite and the
recognizer repair), `a35c027` (the contract, DEC-067 and DEC-068).

**1. The contract** is `docs/specs/technical-spec.md` section 6.6: what a domain supplies as a table
of every `Domain` field and its obligation, the rules each supplied part must satisfy, what a domain
may never touch, where its code lives, what the core does for it, and how it is verified. Section 5's
status sentence was still the pre-DEC-057 book vocabulary and was corrected with it.

**2. The conformance suite** is `backend/tests/test_domain_conformance.py`, parametrized over
`DOMAINS`. Its checks are functions rather than test bodies, so the same code runs over the
registered domains and over broken ones. They split in two, and **the split is the finding**:
`REGISTRY_CHECKS` are what a domain satisfies alone — an unregistered `game` fixture satisfies every
one — and `CORE_CHECKS` are whether the core can host it, which that fixture fails twice over as
soon as it declares a status of its own.

**3. The measurement is DEC-067**, one costed fork per coupling. **Four of ten rows recommend doing
nothing**: the hand-spelled unions are cheaper than any removal, the central cover allowlist is
central on purpose, the book-shaped route is not worth the churn, and the frontend fallback
vocabulary must stay a fallback.

**4. The IGDB paper walk is DEC-068.** DEC-052's prediction **holds** — no seventh seam. Games need
one thing no domain has needed, and it is not a seam: authentication with a lifetime, which fits
inside the adapter. It is explicitly reasoned from published API documentation rather than measured
live, and carries the list of what to verify first. Two parallel domain teams would contend over six
files **and over one alembic head**, which is the argument the file count is not.

**Deviation from acceptance criterion 6 (Phase A changes nothing user-visible).** The suite failed on
its first run against **both shipped domains**: `urlsplit` raises on a malformed authority such as
`http://[`, and `resolve_input` asks each registered domain in turn, so the first recognizer to raise
denied every domain after it its turn — one domain breaking another's add box, reachable by pasting a
typo. Repaired as a prerequisite defect: both recognizers parse through a shared `split_url`, and the
loop isolates a raising recognizer regardless. The user-visible change is that a malformed paste
returns `422 invalid_resolution` with the actionable message instead of `502 provider_failure`.

**Verified.** `make format`, `make check`, `make test` (**460 backend, 129 frontend**),
`npx playwright test` (**86 passed, 2 skipped**), `make build`, `make smoke-container`,
`git diff --check`, `python scripts/validate_project.py` — all green.

**Walkthrough (the gate's Phase A form, plus the repair).** The suite was shown to bite against a
*registered* domain, not only against fixtures: removing `pending`'s hotkey from `ALBUM_STATUSES`
failed `[album-statuses_are_a_usable_vocabulary]`, and renaming `track_count` to `year` failed
`[album-fields_are_described_completely]`; both defects were injected, observed and reverted. The
repair was exercised against the running application on the real dev library with live providers:
`http://[` now answers 422 with "Use an ISBN, an Open Library edition/work URL, a Google Books URL,
or a MusicBrainz release group URL"; an ISBN still resolves (*Cien años de soledad*); a real
MusicBrainz release-group URL still resolves with its 12-track tracklist; `/api/item-types` still
publishes both vocabularies; no errors in the server log.

**Observed and out of scope.** Resolving a release-group URL for "Kind of Blue" returns the Swiss
Blues Authority record rather than Miles Davis's — the arbitrary release selection already recorded
in the handoff, not a regression. The dev library now holds 13 entries, including albums the owner
added since Sprint 027 closed.

### Phase B — delivered 2026-08-15

**The owner authorized all four items** at the gate. They ran smallest-first rather than in DEC-067's
written order, so the largest — the package move — was the tail that could be handed forward intact
if it ran long, which the sprint's own risk note provides for. It did not run long.

**Commits:** `acbbbbf` (health endpoint), `47ac1bc` (cover chooser), `ff94c7f` (migration 0014),
`82fb11c` (domain packages), `fa67410` (adapters and importers), `12dd7fc` (smoke script).

1. **`provider_health` reads the registry** (DEC-067 row 5). The lifespan builds a catalog of every
   provider this build can construct, wired or not; `providers` is its enabled subset, so "disabled,
   not failed" is unchanged. The endpoint orders rows by each domain's own source preference and
   reads the reason off the provider. Rows are now `openlibrary`, `googlebooks`, `musicbrainz` —
   registry order rather than an order the endpoint chose.
2. **The cover chooser is declared per domain** (row 7). `Domain.chooses_covers`, published at
   `/api/item-types`, rendered by the detail page, applied by the endpoint as `not_supported`. The
   conformance suite holds the other half: a domain may only declare it if Open Library is one of its
   preferred sources, which is exactly as far as the shared chooser reaches.
3. **Migration `0014_status_is_the_domains` drops `ck_entries_status`** and its `suggested_status`
   twin (row 1). `validate_status` is the authority and is strictly stronger — the CHECK could only
   hold the union and so accepted `owned` on a book. Score, reread count and provisionality survive,
   asserted by a test, because `copy_from` skips reflection and SQLAlchemy does not reflect SQLite
   CHECKs at all.
4. **Each domain has its own package.** `domains/book/` holds its declaration, its Open Library and
   Google Books adapters and its Goodreads and Calibre importers; `domains/album/` holds its
   declaration and its MusicBrainz adapter. `domain/spec.py` is what a domain *is*;
   `domain/registry.py` is which domains exist; `infrastructure/providers.py` is the shared HTTP
   boundary and nothing else — 701 lines to 153.

**Three defects the move exposed, all repaired here:**

- **`Domain`'s defaults were books' answers.** `statuses`, `default_status`, `entry_fields`,
  `formats` and `entry_panel_label` all defaulted to the book vocabulary, so a domain that forgot one
  inherited it silently — the book shape hiding inside the shared type. They are required now, and
  `chooses_covers` defaults to `False` for the same reason.
- **Both status migrations imported `ALL_STATUSES` from the live registry**, so two installs running
  the same revision a month apart could build different constraints. A migration is history; the
  lists are frozen literals now.
- **The container smoke script imported the Calibre adapter by module path** inside the running
  image. No unit test could see it; `make smoke-container` did, which is the gate working as
  designed.

**Verified.** `make format`, `make check`, `make test` (**469 backend, 130 frontend**),
`npx playwright test` (**86 passed, 2 skipped**), `make build`, `make smoke-container`,
`git diff --check`, `python scripts/validate_project.py` — all green.

**Walkthrough**, against the real dev library (13 entries, books and albums) with live providers, in
a real browser at `localhost:5199`:

- Migration `0014` ran on the real database on startup, after writing
  `backups/pre-migration-20260815T223017Z`. `ck_entries_status` is gone from the live schema and
  `ck_entries_score` is still there.
- **The album detail page no longer offers "Choose a cover"; the book page still does.** Screenshots
  taken of both. "Replace cover" stays on both, correctly — uploading your own always works.
- `GET /api/items/{id}/cover-candidates` answers `not_supported` for all three album items and still
  lists candidates for a book.
- Both adapters answer from their new homes: an Open Library book search returned 18 results, a
  MusicBrainz album search 20.
- An album's status went `owned` → `wishlist` → `owned` with no CHECK behind it, and `read` on that
  same album is still refused with *"Album has no status named 'read'"*.
- No console errors on any page, no errors in the server log.

**Observed and out of scope.** The library tab strip still reads `All | Book | Album`; DEC-065 removes
"All" in Sprint 029, so that is scheduled rather than a regression.

### Third pass — the documentation, 2026-08-15

**Reopened at the owner's request** before closing, to make the new structure findable: a
contributor-facing guide, old documents updated, diagrams, a README pass and a general cleanup
(DEC-070). Same precedent as Sprint 020's Phase B and Sprint 027's add flow.

**Commit:** `f7569fa`.

- **`docs/guides/adding-a-domain.md`** — three diagrams, the whole job as a nine-row table, the
  step-by-step against `domains/album/`, what a domain gets for free, what it may never touch, the two
  unsolved things, and the IGDB verdict as a worked plan.
- **`CONTRIBUTING.md`** — the human entry point the repository never had; `AGENTS.md` still governs
  agent sessions.
- **`docs/README.md`** — the documentation map, labelling every document canonical, historical or
  proposal. **Nothing was deleted**: a historical document is not wrong, it is dated, and four gained
  status headers saying what supersedes them.
- **README** gains a Domains section with the package tree and the registration cost, and points at
  the guide. Its product copy still says books, deliberately — albums are unreleased.
- **Repaired:** technical spec 6.6 still claimed the per-domain layout was "not yet inhabited" (a
  Phase B edit lost to a second write in the same script), and product spec section 9 still said the
  registry would be extracted later and that games and series were Sprints 027 and 028.

**The guide was proved by following it.** A throwaway `game` domain was built from it alone and
registered: **conformance suite green, 480 backend tests green, no migration.** Three things broke
that the guide had not predicted, and all three were repaired rather than documented as gotchas — a
hardcoded `playing` in the suite's own fixture, a closed-world `{"book", "album"}` assertion in
`test_item_types.py`, and an exhaustive `Record<EntryStatus, string>` in the frontend that made a new
status a TypeScript error. The throwaway domain was then removed; the three repairs stayed.

**Verified.** `make check`, `make test` (**469 backend, 130 frontend** after the revert; 480 backend
with the throwaway domain registered), `python scripts/validate_project.py` — green. No application
behaviour changed in this pass beyond the `Partial` fallback table, which is covered by its test.
