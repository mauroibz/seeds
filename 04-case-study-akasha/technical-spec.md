# Book Tracker v1 — Technical Specification

**Status:** implementation baseline 1.0
**Product source:** [`product-spec.md`](product-spec.md)
**Last updated:** 2026-07-21

## 1. System goals and quality attributes

The application is a single-user, LAN-only web application for recording opinions about book editions. It must remain usable with several thousand entries and while metadata providers are unavailable.

Priority order:

1. Preserve user-authored statuses, scores, notes, dates, shelves, and metadata corrections.
2. Keep add and triage workflows keyboard-first and responsive.
3. Render the library entirely from local state; remote calls occur only in explicit search, add, refresh, or enrichment operations.
4. Keep deployment and recovery simple on a ZimaBoard: one application container, one writable data volume, one read-only Calibre mount.
5. Prefer explicit v1 code over speculative plugin or multiuser frameworks.

Target budgets:

- Add a finished book in under 20 seconds under normal provider latency.
- Local API mutations: p95 under 200 ms on target hardware, excluding provider and image work.
- First library page: p95 under 500 ms for 10,000 entries on target hardware.
- No list screen mounts more than a small multiple of visible rows.
- WCAG 2.1 AA keyboard/focus/contrast behavior for core workflows.

The backend follows pragmatic ports-and-adapters boundaries, not a framework-heavy clean-architecture ceremony:

- API routers validate transport shapes and call application services.
- Application services own use-case orchestration and transactions.
- Domain modules contain provider/import protocols, normalization, matching, enums, and invariants without FastAPI or SQLAlchemy dependencies.
- Infrastructure modules implement SQL persistence, HTTP providers, cover storage, Calibre reads, and the durable job runner.

The frontend is feature-oriented. Shared primitive components live in `components/ui`; behavior belongs with its feature. Server state uses TanStack Query. Local component state is preferred over a global store until a concrete cross-page need appears.

## 3. Backend baseline

Use Python 3.12 with:

- FastAPI and Pydantic v2 / pydantic-settings;
- SQLAlchemy 2 declarative mappings and Alembic;
- SQLite through a single configured engine; application services may remain synchronous unless measured load justifies async DB access;
- `httpx.AsyncClient` for metadata providers;
- Pillow for cover validation and JPEG conversion;
- pytest, pytest-cov, respx, and time/path injection for deterministic tests;
- Ruff for formatting/linting and mypy in strict-enough project mode.

Application startup must:

1. validate settings and create `/data`, `/data/covers`, `/data/imports`, and `/data/backups` if absent;
2. enable SQLite `PRAGMA foreign_keys=ON` for every connection, WAL mode, and a bounded busy timeout;
3. refuse to auto-create or mutate schema outside Alembic;
4. report schema mismatch with a useful startup error;
5. once Sprint 011 introduces the jobs schema, start one cooperative durable-job polling loop in the FastAPI lifespan;
6. when that runner exists, stop accepting job work and cancel it cleanly on shutdown.

Do not run multiple Uvicorn workers: the target is one process and the v1 job lease design assumes it. Tests must still enforce idempotency in case a job is retried after a crash.

## 4. Configuration

Environment variables:

| Variable | Required | Default | Meaning |
|---|---:|---|---|
| `BOOK_TRACKER_DATA_DIR` | no | `/data` | DB, covers, staged imports, backups |
| `BOOK_TRACKER_CALIBRE_DIR` | no | `/calibre` | read-only Calibre library root |
| `BOOK_TRACKER_DATABASE_URL` | no | derived | SQLite URL, overridable in tests |
| `GOOGLE_BOOKS_API_KEY` | no | empty | enables Google Books provider |
| `USER_AGENT_CONTACT` | yes in production | none | contact included in provider User-Agent |
| `TZ` | no | `UTC` | display/default local timezone; stored dates remain ISO |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | no | `INFO` | structured application log threshold |
| `BOOK_TRACKER_ATTACHMENT_MAX_BYTES` | no | `26214400` | per-file cap on attachments; bounds the worst file, not the total |

Commit `.env.example` without secrets. Production must fail fast if `USER_AGENT_CONTACT` is absent; tests and local development may use an explicit test default.

## 5. Canonical data model

All timestamps are UTC RFC 3339 strings at API boundaries and timezone-aware Python datetimes internally. User-entered reading dates are ISO `YYYY-MM-DD`. Scores are nullable integers 1–10. **Status is per-domain**: each domain declares its own vocabulary and every domain has `unsorted` (DEC-057, section 6.6). Books are `unsorted`/`read`/`reading`/`to_read`/`wishlist`/`dropped`; albums are `unsorted`/`wishlist`/`pending`/`owned`. A write is validated against the item's own domain; a filter spans the union.

### 5.1 Tables

`items`

- `id` integer primary key
- `type` text, default `book`
- `title` required text
- `subtitle`, `year`, and `cover_path` nullable
- `identifiers` optional JSON API/cache projection derived from relational identifiers; never the uniqueness authority
- `metadata` required JSON-as-text with application validation
- `creator_primary` generated from the first metadata creator — the name **as written**, which is what the `q` filter matches and what the API falls back to when the record carries no rendered `credit`
- `creator_sort_override` nullable owner text: the sort name corrected by hand, or seeded from a Calibre `authors.sort`
- `creator_sort` and `creator_sort_normalized` nullable, derived from `creator_sort_override` or the `creator_sort_name` heuristic and maintained by the same mapper event as the columns above (DEC-051). Ordering reads these; display and search do not
- `created_at`, `updated_at` required
- case-insensitive title index

`item_identifiers`

- `item_id` foreign key to items, cascade delete
- `kind`, `normalized_value`, and original `value` required
- primary key `(item_id, kind, normalized_value)`
- unique `(kind, normalized_value)` for authoritative identities; ISBN-10 and ISBN-13 share canonical kind `isbn`, while Calibre UUID uses a stable namespaced kind

A valid ISBN-10 is converted to canonical ISBN-13 before storage, so conversion-equivalent values collide on the same `(kind, normalized_value)`. Provider identities live in `item_sources`, avoiding duplicate authority. Relational constraints—not check-then-insert or JSON queries—close duplicate races.

`item_sources`

- `item_id` foreign key to items, cascade delete
- `source`, `source_id`, and boolean `is_primary` required
- primary key `(source, source_id)`; unique `(item_id, source)`
- at most one primary source per item, enforced by a partial unique index

A merged search candidate can retain both Open Library and Google Books identities. The primary source selects explicit refresh; manual-only items have none.

Every mutable table has `created_at` and `updated_at` unless it is an immutable append-only effect row; jobs/batches additionally use their lifecycle timestamps.

`entries`

- product-spec fields plus foreign key `item_id` with restrict-on-delete
- checks for score, nonnegative `reread_count`, and boolean `score_provisional`. **There is no CHECK on `status`** (migration `0014`, DEC-067 row 1): the vocabulary is the domain's, and a constraint listing the union of every domain's values could neither express "`owned` is not a book status" nor admit a domain added later without a migration on this table. `validate_status`, keyed on the item's own domain, is the authority and is strictly stronger
- unique `(user_id, item_id)`
- indexes supporting status/score/date list paths

`entry_formats`

- one row per (entry, format); `ON DELETE CASCADE` from `entries`, indexed by `format`
- the value is a closed vocabulary the domain declares (DEC-059), not a joined row: a
  shelf is something the owner invents, a format is something the domain knows
- writes are validated against the item's own domain and refused with 422 otherwise

`shelves` and `entry_shelves`

- as in product spec, with normalized unique slug per user
- shelf rename updates name and slug transactionally and rejects collisions
- deleting a shelf cascades join rows, never entries

`import_batches`

- `id` UUID text primary key
- `kind` (`goodreads` or `calibre`), `fingerprint`, `state`
- source descriptor JSON; never contains arbitrary host paths returned to browsers
- preview summary JSON, counters JSON, error JSON
- `created_at`, `committed_at`, `undo_expires_at`
- unique `(kind, fingerprint)` for committed input identity where practical

`import_records`

- `id` integer primary key; `batch_id` foreign key and source `row_number`
- normalized payload JSON, matched item/entry IDs, match kind, planned action
- conflicts JSON, validation errors JSON, and explicit ambiguity resolution
- unique `(batch_id, row_number)`

Preview persists these normalized records, so commit applies exactly the reviewed plan rather than reparsing an upload or rereading a Calibre database that may have changed.

`import_effects`

- `effect_id` integer primary key and `batch_id`, `record_id`, effect/entity types, entity ID
- before-values and after-values JSON
- monotonic `effect_id` provides deterministic reverse-order undo

This ledger makes undo safe: reverse only effects recorded for the batch; delete entities only when the batch created them and they remain unmodified/unreferenced; revert a filled field only if its current value still equals the recorded imported value. Late jobs from an undone batch are ignored.

`jobs`

- `id` UUID, nullable `batch_id`, `kind`, `state` (`queued`, `running`, `succeeded`, `failed`, `cancelled`)
- payload/progress/error JSON, attempts, `available_at`, heartbeat/lease timestamps
- `created_at`, `updated_at`, `finished_at`

Jobs survive restart. Handlers are idempotent. The lifespan runner claims one queued job in a short transaction, processes network/file work outside that transaction, and persists progress. On startup, expired `running` jobs return to `queued` with incremented attempts. Cap retries and expose terminal failure.

`attachments`

- `id` integer primary key
- `item_id` foreign key to items, cascade delete
- `filename` required text — the name the owner uploaded, held here and **never** used as a path
- `byte_size` and `sha256` required
- unique on `(item_id, sha256)`, so re-uploading the same bytes to the same item updates the name rather than duplicating the row
- indexed on `item_id` and on `sha256`, the second because deletion is refcounted

Blobs live at `{data_dir}/attachments/{sha256[:2]}/{sha256}`, content-addressed
(DEC-048). Identical bytes occupy one blob however many items reference them, and a
blob is removed only when no row still points at its digest. The backup hardlinks
blobs rather than copying them; where `/data` and `/backups` are separate volumes —
which is the shipped Compose deployment — it links from a sibling backup instead,
and copies only when neither is possible.

A blob can still be orphaned by a route that does not go through
`delete_attachment` — an item deleted outside the application, or a crash between
writing the blob and committing its row. `akasha-attachments reclaim` collects
those (DEC-050). It reports by default and removes nothing without `--apply`,
reads the filesystem before the database so a row committed between the two reads
protects its blob, never touches a blob younger than an hour, and leaves anything
under `attachments/` that it did not write. A blob a backup has linked survives
it: the backup holds its own reference to the same inode.

Uploads and downloads stream. `BlobWriter` hashes and writes a chunk at a time
into a temporary and moves it under its digest at commit, so the per-file cap is
enforced as bytes arrive rather than after the whole upload is buffered, and
downloads are a `FileResponse`. The download's validator is an ETag over digest
**and** filename, not `immutable`: the blob cannot change but the response
carries the editable name, so a rename has to be able to invalidate it.

### 5.2 Deletion and orphan policy

Deleting an entry deletes its shelf joins but retains the item, source links, and cover as a cache. No orphan-prune endpoint is part of v1; that product question is deferred. Import undo may remove an orphan item only when its ledger proves the batch created it and no entry references it.

### 5.3 Migration policy

- Alembic from the first schema.
- Every schema change includes upgrade, downgrade where safe, and a migration test from the previous head.
- Never call `metadata.create_all()` in production. Tests may use migrations so schema behavior matches production.
- Back up the live DB before production migration.

## 6. Core application contracts

### 6.1 Normalization and identity

Normalize ISBN by stripping armor/separators and validating ISBN-10/13 checksums; convert ISBN-10 to canonical ISBN-13 when possible. Normalize near-match text with Unicode NFKD, combining-mark removal, casefold, punctuation-to-space, and collapsed whitespace.

Matching precedence for imports and add dedupe:

1. authoritative provider source ID;
2. canonical ISBN-13 (including validated ISBN-10 conversion-equivalence);
3. Calibre UUID;
4. normalized title plus normalized first author as an **ambiguous suggestion only**.

A fuzzy title/author result never merges automatically because the model is edition-level: translations and reprints commonly share that key. It requires an explicit preview decision or creates a separate item. A match result records rule, confidence, and decision provenance. If two or more exact identities from one record resolve to different existing items, return a typed `identity_conflict`, quarantine that record for explicit resolution, and attach no new identifier or entry automatically.

### 6.2 Provider boundary

The domain defines separate immutable models: `SearchCandidate`, `ItemPayload`, `ImportRecord`, `MatchDecision`, and `ImportPlan`, plus an async `Provider` protocol. Search candidates support multiple source references after merge. Import records carry personal fields, source-row provenance, validation errors, and conflict alternatives; they never masquerade as provider candidates. Provider and import adapters never leak raw source responses above infrastructure.

- Search providers concurrently with an independent five-second timeout.
- Return successful results when one provider fails and log a structured warning.
- Return a typed `providers_unavailable` error only if every enabled provider fails.
- Google Books is disabled, not failed, when no key exists.
- Bound result count and response size.
- Mock all provider traffic in tests; no default test contacts public APIs. Mocking transport is required; substituting a mock for the provider method under test is not a proof of that method and does not satisfy a correctness criterion. Boundary behavior is proven by replaying a committed recorded response (DEC-025).

Open Library edition lookup by ISBN uses `https://openlibrary.org/isbn/{isbn}.json`. That endpoint answers with a redirect to the edition record, so the shared provider client must follow redirects. `https://openlibrary.org/books/{id}.json` accepts an OLID only and returns 404 for an ISBN; it is never used for ISBN lookup.

Background enrichment tries Open Library first and falls back to Google Books when Open Library fails or returns nothing usable — a payload carrying no year, no cover, and no metadata counts as nothing usable. A job that exhausts both providers records a typed, human-readable reason retrievable through `GET /api/import/jobs/{id}`; enrichment failures are never swallowed. The reason is two columns: `jobs.error` holds the sentence a person reads, `jobs.error_code` the stable machine-readable type, and the endpoint returns both.

The enrichment queue has exactly one producer and one consumer, and both must exist. Committing an import enqueues `enrich_item` for the rows *that batch* created or matched, and for those only, so batch progress never reports work the import did not cause. The job runner is driven by a background task started in the application lifespan, which reclaims expired leases on idle passes and is cancelled on shutdown. `POST /api/enrichment/backfill` queues the same work for items already persisted with empty fields; it only ever enqueues, and the handler it enqueues fills empty fields only, so no path through it can overwrite a hand edit.

Enrichment installs a missing cover after its metadata transaction commits, never inside it: covers are remote and image work, and a cover failure must not undo a metadata fill. An item that already has a cover is never re-fetched.

Undated search results are resolved against `/works/{id}/editions.json` for every result, not the first, bounded by a concurrency semaphore. Publication dates are parsed by finding a year anywhere in the value, because Open Library publishes `"1984"`, `"1984-03"`, and `"Mar 09, 2005"` interchangeably.

Merged search results preserve the relevance ordering the providers returned. Each candidate retains its provider-returned position, the two providers are interleaved fairly, and title-match, language, and cover-presence signals act only as tie-breakers. Merging must never re-sort results by title.

Provider availability is reported by `GET /api/health/providers` — one row per provider with `available` and a `reason`, plus a `degraded` flag — so the interface can render a degraded-search state. The absence of `GOOGLE_BOOKS_API_KEY` is logged at startup rather than silently reducing search to one provider. This endpoint is deliberately separate from readiness: a missing key must never make the application look down.

Open Library search must not map work-level `first_publish_year` into edition publication year. It may expose that value separately as `original_year`; `items.year` is populated only from edition data. A work URL resolves to an edition-picker list, preferring editions with valid ISBNs and useful language metadata for ranking, but never silently chooses one. A chosen result always carries an edition identity.

### 6.3 Cache-on-add transaction

1. Fetch and normalize the primary provider payload outside a DB transaction. Secondary `source_refs` supplied by the client become authoritative only after provider validation or agreement on canonical ISBN; ignore unverifiable refs.
2. Download, validate, resize, and encode a cover to a unique temporary file outside the transaction; enforce content-type, byte, pixel, URL, and timeout limits. Cover preparation failure is non-fatal.
3. Begin a short `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` write transaction, re-resolve exact identity through unique relational constraints, and insert/reuse item, identifiers, sources, and entry. Commit without a cover path.
4. After the relational commit, atomically install a prepared cover and update `cover_path` in a second short transaction, or enqueue an idempotent cover job. Failure leaves the valid entry intact and cleans/retries temporary files.
5. Return `201` for a new entry and `200` with `already_exists=true` for an existing entry. Protect double-submit through constraints and an idempotency key or equivalent request token.

Do not hold a SQLite write lock during remote, parsing, or image work. `POST /api/entries` remains one client round trip; relational creation is atomic, while cover installation is explicitly eventual and non-fatal.

### 6.4 Fill-empty versus explicit refresh

Import and resync may fill only fields considered empty (`NULL`, empty string, empty list/object as defined per field). They never overwrite non-empty user-visible fields. Identifier unions may add a previously absent key only when all exact identities resolve to the same item. For multiple source rows creating one new entry within the same commit, source confidence may choose the initial value; once an entry exists, a conflicting incoming score/status/note/date is recorded only in the batch's `import_records`, never on the entry itself. A manual entry edit always wins and must not be reverted by later imports.

Explicit item refresh requires `confirm_overwrite: true`. Fetch and validate the replacement first; on timeout, malformed data, or invalid payload, leave the item unchanged. In one short transaction, overwrite only provider-managed fields actually present in the successful response and add authoritative identifiers/source links. Omitted provider fields do not erase old values, and entry opinion fields are never touched. A manual-only item with no primary source returns a typed conflict.

### 6.5 Imports

Preview is mandatory and has no library side effects beyond durable staging/audit records. Uploaded Goodreads files are copied to `/data/imports/{batch_id}/` with size limits and a SHA-256 fingerprint. Parse and persist normalized `ImportRecord` rows, match decisions, explicit ambiguities, row errors, and preview counts. Calibre requests identify only a path relative to configured `BOOK_TRACKER_CALIBRE_DIR`; resolve and verify it cannot escape the mount, open `metadata.db` with `mode=ro` and `PRAGMA query_only=ON`, and stage its normalized rows during preview so commit never rereads a changing source DB.

Commit accepts a preview batch ID, rejects stale/missing/mismatched previews or unresolved ambiguities, and applies the persisted plan in one bounded `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` transaction. Revalidate authoritative identifiers because the library may have changed since preview. If exact keys now resolve to different items, mark the record `identity_conflict` and abort that record rather than choosing a winner. Otherwise create/reuse items and entries, fill empty item fields, attach shelves only to newly created entries, record audit conflicts/effects, and persist enrichment jobs before commit. Existing entries are never reset to `unsorted` or modified. All parsing, Calibre reads, cover copies, image work, and provider calls stay outside the write transaction. A uniqueness race may reload and reuse a winner only when every exact identity agrees on that item.

Enrichment is enqueued after commit and limited to about two provider requests per second. Every metadata or cover fill performed for an import appends its `import_effect` in the same short transaction as the mutation, so undo includes asynchronous effects. Triage is immediately usable. Job progress is polled from the API.

Undo is available in the UI until `undo_expires_at` (24 hours), while the durable audit ledger remains recoverable. Reverse effects in order, cancel queued jobs, and make late job results no-ops. Delete only batch-created entities that remain unmodified and unreferenced; revert a filled field only when its current value equals recorded `after_values`. The response reports reverted, retained, and skipped effects, and repeated undo is harmless.

### 6.6 The domain contract

A **domain** is a kind of thing the library holds: books, albums. This section is the whole contract. A new domain is built from it alone; reading how albums were built is not required and is not a substitute, because that record describes one domain's choices rather than the rules (DEC-052, DEC-066).

**The core is neutral and stays that way.** `items` has been `type` / `title` / `subtitle` / `year` / `cover_path` / `identifiers` / opaque `metadata` since Sprint 002, and `entries` hold one person's opinion of an item. No shared layer branches on which domain it is holding; a domain is never translated into another domain's vocabulary, and there is no `if item_type == ...` anywhere above the registry. **A shared layer that needs to know the domain asks the registry for a declaration; it does not grow a branch.**

```text
  api/ · application/ · infrastructure/     shared layers — never branch on item type
                    ▲
                    │ ask the registry for a declaration
  domain/spec.py     what a domain IS          domain/registry.py   which ones EXIST
                    ▲                                    ▲
      ┌─────────────┴─────────────┐        ┌─────────────┴─────────────┐
      │  domains/book/            │        │  domains/album/           │
      │  declaration · adapters   │        │  declaration · adapter    │
      │  · importers              │        │                           │
      └───────────────────────────┘        └───────────────────────────┘
                     never import each other
```

**The registry is code, not a plugin runtime** (product spec section 2). A domain is a Python object registered at import time. There is no discovery, no entry point, no sandbox and no versioning between a domain and the core: they are built and shipped together.

#### What a domain supplies

One `Domain` (defined in `backend/src/book_tracker/domain/spec.py`, declared in `backend/src/book_tracker/domains/<item_type>/__init__.py`), whose every field is an obligation:

| Field | Obligation |
|---|---|
| `item_type` | The value stored in `items.type`. **Permanent** — a lowercase identifier, never renamed, never user-facing. |
| `label` | The user-facing name of one item ("Book", "Album"). Copy, and free to change. |
| `identity` | An `IdentityStrategy`: how two candidates are judged the same record, and which source wins a merge. |
| `fields` | The ordered `FieldSpec` list describing this domain's metadata. Storage stays opaque; this is the only description of it that exists. |
| `enriches` | Whether background enrichment applies at all. `False` is a complete answer, not a gap. |
| `statuses` | The `StatusSpec` vocabulary, in the order a control offers it. Must contain `unsorted`, which must not be choosable. |
| `default_status` | What a newly added entry gets when nobody chose. Must be one of `statuses`. |
| `entry_fields` | Which of `date_started` / `date_finished` / `reread_count` this domain's entries have. Anything absent is **refused on write**, not merely hidden. |
| `formats` | The `FormatSpec` vocabulary for how a copy is held. Closed and declared, which is what a shelf is not (DEC-059). |
| `entry_panel_label` | The heading over the personal region of the detail page. "Your reading data" is a book's phrase. |
| `recognize` | What a string pasted into the add box means to this domain, or `None`. |
| `chooses_covers` | Whether to offer the cover chooser. The shared chooser is Open Library's work-editions path, so only a domain that source serves may declare it; a domain declaring `false` is never offered a control that could only say no. |

Plus, outside the record itself:

- **An adapter** implementing the `Provider` protocol (`domain/providers.py`), in the domain's own package as `domains/<item_type>/providers.py`: `name`, `item_type`, `async search(query, limit)` and `async fetch(source_id)`, returning `SearchCandidate` / `ItemPayload`. It owns its own rate limit, User-Agent and authentication, and never leaks a raw provider response above infrastructure (section 6.2). Its boundary behaviour is proven against committed recorded responses, never against a mock of the method under test (DEC-025).
- **Cover URLs**, as candidates only. The shared pipeline keeps sole ownership of https upgrading, the host allowlist, the redirect policy and the pixel and byte bounds; a domain whose art lives on a new host adds that host to the allowlist and nothing else (seam 4).
- **A curated sort name where the source knows one.** `SearchCandidate.creator_sort` seeds the owner's override; the `creator_sort_name` heuristic runs only when nothing knew. A source that distinguishes a person from a group must say so this way rather than let the heuristic invert `Daft Punk` (DEC-051, DEC-052).

#### Rules each supplied part must satisfy

- **Statuses.** Values are permanent and stored; labels are copy. `unsorted` exists in every domain because imports land there and the default library view hides it, and it is never offered as a choice. Every choosable status carries a triage hotkey, unique within the domain — the hotkey lives on the status rather than in a second table that can drift from it.
- **Formats.** Multi-valued on the entry and independent of status, so "wishlist → vinyl" is expressible. The vocabulary is closed and declared; a value the owner invents is a **shelf**, and the two must never converge into one control (DEC-059).
- **Entry fields.** A domain's entries have only the passage fields it declares. Declaring a name outside `PASSAGE_FIELDS` is a defect the conformance suite refuses: `validate_entry_fields` refuses what is *absent*, so an invented name would be a field the domain believes in and nothing writes.
- **Metadata fields.** Names are permanent, labels are copy. A `rows` field declares `columns` and no other field type may; the renderer and the validator both key on that. A field may never shadow `title`, `subtitle`, `year` or `creator_sort_override` — those are neutral item columns edited *beside* the metadata, and a metadata field of the same name would render twice and save to one of them.
- **Identity.** `identity_key(candidate) -> str | None`, where `None` means *never merge this candidate*. That is a complete answer, not a degraded one: barcodes are not unique across releases, so albums have no cross-provider identity and merging on a weaker key would be wrong rather than approximate. `source_preference` decides which row of a merged group is primary and breaks ranking ties.
- **The URL recognizer must answer for any string and must never raise.** `resolve_input` asks every registered domain in turn, so a recognizer that raises does not fail its own domain — it denies every domain after it in the registry its turn. Parse through `split_url`, which is the shared guard (`urlsplit` raises on a malformed authority such as `http://[`). The shared loop isolates a raising recognizer as well, so the failure is contained; a domain that raises is still in breach.

#### What a domain may never touch

- **`items` and `entries` columns.** Everything a domain knows that the neutral columns do not carry goes in opaque `metadata`. A domain never adds a column, and never stores a value one of the four reserved item columns already holds.
- **Another domain.** No domain imports another, reads another's vocabulary, or renders under another's labels. A value that exists in two domains (`wishlist`, `digital`) is a coincidence of spelling, not shared state.
- **The shared pipelines.** Keyset pagination and cursors, the job runner, the import ledger and undo, backup, attachments, shelves, and the score/notes/dates entry layer are the core's. A domain that appears to need a change in one of them has found a seventh seam, and that is a decision to record, not a patch to make (DEC-055).
- **The cover pipeline's safety rules.** A domain supplies URLs; it does not relax the scheme, the allowlist, the redirect check or the size bounds.
- **The screens.** No screen branches on the item type. A domain that needs a screen to render differently declares the difference — a label, a vocabulary, a field spec — and the screen renders the declaration.

#### Where a domain's code lives

One package per domain, `backend/src/book_tracker/domains/<item_type>/`, holding its registry entry, its field spec, its status and format vocabularies, its identity strategy, its URL recognizer, its provider adapter and its importers. The point is that **one domain's team edits one directory**, so two domains can be built in parallel without contending for the same files.

Books and albums live there as of Sprint 028: `domains/book/` holds its declaration, its Open Library and Google Books adapters and its Goodreads and Calibre importers; `domains/album/` holds its declaration and its MusicBrainz adapter. What remains in `infrastructure/providers.py` is the shared HTTP boundary — the bounded retrying JSON read, the retry policy and the one client every adapter uses — which belongs to no domain. `domain/spec.py` is what a domain is; `domain/registry.py` is which domains exist.

**The practical guide to building one is [`docs/guides/adding-a-domain.md`](../guides/adding-a-domain.md)**, which walks this section step by step with diagrams and a worked example. This section is the contract; that guide is how to satisfy it.

Exactly three things stay shared, and they are the registration points rather than the domain's substance:

1. **The registry** — the domain is added to `DOMAINS`, which is what makes it exist.
2. **Provider wiring** in the application lifespan, where its adapter is constructed with its configuration.
3. **Migrations**, which are global by nature and are the one path to a schema change.

Anything else a domain has to edit outside its own package is a coupling, and a coupling is a defect to record and cost. Two remain after Sprint 028, both deliberately (DEC-066, DEC-067): the published unions (`EntryStatus`, `EntryFormat`, `ItemTypeName`), which are three type-safe lines per domain that a test refuses to let drift, and the cover host allowlist, which is central precisely so a domain cannot widen it from its own package. The third — `entries.ck_entries_status`, a CHECK rendered from the registry when its migration was written — was removed in migration `0014`, because a domain needing a schema change on a shared table is not a coupling that can be paid per domain: two domain teams would both write that migration against the same alembic head.

#### How the core serves a domain

- `GET /api/item-types` publishes every field of every registered domain, and every screen renders from it: the library's tabs, the status chips, the format selector, the triage hotkeys, the metadata dialog and the detail page's field order.
- **A write is validated against the item's own domain** (`LibraryService._validated`), refused with a 422 that names the domain — the value is very often valid one row further down the library, so "invalid status" alone would send the reader hunting. A bulk write spanning domains is refused whole.
- **A filter legitimately spans domains**, so query parameters validate against the union of every domain's values while writes validate against one domain. `type` is not an ordinary facet dimension: both status facets clear it so the inbox badge keeps agreeing with the domain-agnostic triage screen, while `format_counts` applies it because that selector sits under the tab (DEC-062).
- Enrichment is queued only for domains that declare `enriches`.

#### How a domain is verified

`backend/tests/test_domain_conformance.py` is parametrized over `DOMAINS`: a domain is held to the contract **by existing**, and nothing in that file is extended when one is added. Its checks split in two, and the split is load-bearing. `REGISTRY_CHECKS` are what a domain satisfies on its own, and an unregistered fixture domain satisfies all of them — that is what makes this a contract rather than a description of books and albums. `CORE_CHECKS` are whether the core can host the domain: whether the published unions carry its values, and whether the database will accept them.

The suite is required to be able to fail. Malformed domains declared inside the file — a status with no label, a default outside the vocabulary, a `rows` field with no columns, a recognizer that raises — must each be rejected by the check that owns them.

## 7. HTTP API contract

All routes are under `/api`. JSON uses snake_case. Validation errors follow FastAPI's standard 422 shape; domain failures use:

```json
{"error":{"code":"stable_machine_code","message":"human readable","details":{}}}
```

Never expose tracebacks, host filesystem paths, provider keys, or raw SQL.

### 7.1 Routes

The product-spec route list is authoritative, with these refinements:

- Define static routes such as `/entries/bulk` before `/entries/{entry_id}`.
- Bulk mutation accepts either explicit `entry_ids` or a validated server-side filter plus `excluded_entry_ids`; never both. This supports select-all across unloaded virtual rows without sending thousands of IDs. Return affected count and apply in one transaction.
- `GET /entries` accepts repeated `status`, `shelf`, `format`, `type`, `q`, `sort`, `order`, `after`, `limit`, and triage-only flags. Default excludes `unsorted`; an explicit filter can include it. `type` selects domains and is validated against the registry; unlike `shelf` and `format`, repeating it *widens*, because a row has exactly one type. The response is `{items, next_cursor, total, facets}`. `facets.status_counts` is the whole-library total per status — what the inbox badge counts — `facets.status_counts_by_type` splits the same counts by item type, because a status two domains share is not one number on a screen that lists each domain's statuses separately, and `facets.format_counts` does the same for formats. Each facet clears its own dimension, so a count reads as "what you would get if you clicked this". **`type` is the exception and is not one dimension** (DEC-062): both status facets clear it, so the inbox badge keeps agreeing with the domain-agnostic `/triage` and an unselected tab still has a count to show, while `format_counts` applies it, because that selector sits under the tab.
- `GET /item-types` publishes each domain's metadata fields, its ordered status vocabulary (value, label, whether it is directly choosable, triage key), its default status, which entry fields it has, its formats, and the heading for the personal region of the detail page. Every screen renders from it rather than branching on the item type (seam 5b).
- Writes validate `status`, `formats` and the passage fields (`date_started`, `date_finished`, `reread_count`) against **the item's own domain**, returning 422 with a message naming the domain. A bulk write spanning domains is refused whole rather than half-applied.
- `POST /entries/accept-suggested` returns affected count and operates in one transaction over the server-side filter, not client-loaded IDs.
- `POST /items/{id}/refresh` requires explicit overwrite confirmation.
- `POST /entries` requires `confirm_near_match=true` before creating a title/first-author
  near-match; the initial 409 includes advisory existing entry IDs and performs no write. It also
  accepts `notes`, `formats` and the passage fields, each validated against the item's own domain
  and refused with a 422 naming it — the same rule `PATCH` follows, applied **before the write**, so
  a refusal never leaves a half-added row.
- **Two searches exist and they are not the same kind of thing.** `GET /entries?q=` is SQL over
  stored normalized projections: free, local, and reached by every keystroke the library filter
  makes. `GET /search?q=&type=` fans out to the chosen domain's providers at five seconds each and
  is counted against a daily budget (DEC-045). Since Sprint 029 both are spent from `/` behind one
  input, so **which of them a keystroke reaches is a frontend rule, stated in section 8** — the
  backend contract is unchanged, and the invariant it protects is unchanged with it: rendering a
  library page consults no provider, at any query length. A search reaches only the named domain's
  providers (DEC-052 seam 4); the spend is recorded and never blocked, because somebody is waiting
  for it.
- `GET /search/resolve` takes the same input when it is a URL or a bare ISBN and skips the keyword
  search entirely. It is domain-neutral: a MusicBrainz release-group URL resolves exactly as an Open
  Library edition URL does, which is why the one bar advertises the path for every domain.
- `GET /search/preview` returns one candidate's full provider payload and writes nothing. It exists
  because a search result carries an identity but not a description, a page count or a tracklist,
  and there is no provider response cache, so it is one live request per call (DEC-064). It follows
  `search`'s quota rule rather than enrichment's: the spend is recorded and never blocked, because
  somebody is waiting for it.
- `POST /items/{id}/cover` accepts one JPEG, PNG, or WebP multipart upload, applies the shared
  byte/pixel/600px limits, and retains the previous valid cover if validation or installation fails.
- Import commit bodies contain preview batch IDs, not client-controlled source payloads.
- `POST /import/calibre/preview` accepts only `library_path` relative to the configured mount;
  `POST /import/calibre/commit` accepts the durable batch ID and ambiguity choices. Preview responses
  expose normalized Calibre UUID/book identity and whether a local cover was staged, never a source
  filesystem path.
- Cover files are served from a controlled route or static mount with immutable cache headers; database paths are relative and never accepted from clients.
- `GET /api/export` streams the whole library rather than buffering it: rows are walked in keyset
  batches of 200 and each is serialized and yielded on its own, so peak memory tracks the batch and
  not the corpus (measured at x1.07 JSON / x1.66 CSV peak for x10 output). Select **columns, not
  mapped entities** — an ORM entity is retained by the `Session` identity map for as long as the
  session lives, and `yield_per` does not help because SQLite's driver has no server-side cursor and
  materializes the result anyway. The JSON omits every derived column by design; the CSV neutralizes
  leading `=`, `+`, `-`, `@` so a spreadsheet reads a note as text, which makes the JSON the lossless
  artifact and the CSV the convenience view.
- Add `GET /api/health/live` and `GET /api/health/ready`; readiness verifies DB access and migration head, not public provider availability. `GET /api/health/providers` reports provider configuration separately and never affects readiness.

OpenAPI is the API contract. Generate or validate frontend request/response types from it in CI so backend/frontend drift fails checks.

### 7.2 Keyset pagination

Use an opaque base64url-encoded, versioned JSON cursor containing sort key, direction, last normalized value, last ID, and null bucket. Clients must treat it as opaque. Reject a cursor when sort/filter identity does not match the request. **The filter identity must list every filter**, `type` included: one that omits a filter accepts a cursor cut under a different query and then skips or repeats a page silently, which is a wrong answer rather than an error. **The version is currently 2**; it is bumped whenever a stored projection a cursor compares against changes meaning, so a cursor issued before the change fails with `invalid_cursor` rather than silently skipping or repeating a page.

Every ordering is a whitelisted SQL expression plus `id` tie-breaker. NULL values always sort last using an explicit null bucket in both ordering and seek predicate. Text ordering, search, and cursor comparison read stored normalized projections. Search and the `title` sort read `items.title_normalized` and `items.creator_primary_normalized`; the `creator` *ordering* reads `items.creator_sort_normalized` instead, because the name a creator sorts under is not the name it displays under (DEC-051). They hold the domain `normalize_text` value (Unicode NFKD, combining-mark removal, casefold, punctuation-to-space, and whitespace collapse) and maintained by a mapper event on every item write (DEC-036). They are not generated columns, because SQLite generated columns cannot call an application-registered function, which is also why the earlier per-row UDF was replaced: it cost 312 ms p95 on a contended 10,000-entry first page. Tests cover asc/desc, nulls, duplicate values, deleted boundary rows, filter changes, malformed cursors, and `EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN` for common composite indexes. `total` is exact but advisory under concurrent edits; do not add an invalidation-prone count cache until measurement proves it necessary. Any mutation of the active sort key invalidates infinite pages and reloads from page one while restoring focus by entry ID.

## 8. Frontend architecture and behavior

Use strict TypeScript, React Router, TanStack Query, TanStack Virtual, React Hook Form with schema validation, shadcn/ui primitives, Tailwind tokens, and Motion. Avoid a custom global state store in v1.

Design tokens:

- dark-first zinc near-black surfaces, not pure black: zinc-950 background, zinc-900 surface, zinc-800 border, zinc-50 text, zinc-400 muted;
- a deliberate non-default saturated accent: amber-400 on a zinc-950 foreground, with a score ramp of red-400 (1–3), amber-400 (4–6), lime-400 (7–8), emerald-400 (9–10) (DEC-026);
- Geist or Inter with bundled/local or privacy-safe loading. Inter is self-hosted and bundled; naming a font without loading it is not compliance;
- small controls carry their own radius token: at the card radius a 16 px checkbox reads as a radio button;
- these are declared once as Tailwind theme tokens and CSS variables. Inline colour literals in components are a defect;
- no generic border-shadow card grid;
- visible focus rings and touch targets at least 44 px where practical;
- all motion disabled/reduced under `prefers-reduced-motion`.

Cross-cutting behavior:

- Query keys include every server filter/sort value.
- Optimistic mutations snapshot and roll back cache; failed writes announce an accessible error and never silently lose input.
- Search input is debounced and cancellable; stale responses cannot replace newer results.
- **One input feeds both searches, and the rule deciding which it reaches is load-bearing**
  (DEC-065, as built in DEC-073). The library filter is debounced **250 ms** into the URL's `q` and
  is the only thing typing normally reaches. A **provider** search fires only when every one of
  these holds: the query has been still for **~800 ms** measured from the last keystroke, it is at
  least **three characters**, the URL has caught up with the box, the library has actually answered
  — pending or errored is "we do not know yet", not "the library has nothing" — and it answered with
  **zero** rows. It never fires twice for the same string and domain. The **Add** button overrides
  all of it and searches immediately, serving a repeat from what it already holds.
  - Every clause is there because the literal rule — search whenever the library misses — fires once
    per keystroke while typing any title not already owned, which is every add. That is the quota
    (DEC-045) and the tier breach DEC-044 already measured. **The rule is verified by counting
    requests, not by inspection.**
  - The provider search owns an `AbortController` and a request-id guard: a superseded request is
    aborted rather than left running against a rate-limited API, and a late response for an older
    query may not replace a newer result set. Both are quota protection, not tidiness.
  - Results belong to the domain that produced them, and switching domain clears them rather than
    showing one domain's results under another's name.
- **Two result sets on one page are two regions, not one.** The library is a `role="feed"` with
  server-side `aria-posinset`/`aria-setsize` (DEC-038); provider results are a plainly labelled
  `section` beside it and are never announced as feed items. They render **below** the library:
  the library virtualizes against the window, so a variable-height block above it moves the
  `scrollMargin` every row measures itself against, which is the Sprint 013 class of bug avoided by
  construction rather than survived (DEC-073).
- **Keyboard shortcuts belong to the surface that has focus.** With provider results on screen,
  `j`/`k` and the digit shortcuts stay with the library and do nothing from inside the results
  region, so one list's shortcut never acts on the other list.
- Route-level error boundaries and useful empty/loading states are mandatory.
- Keyboard shortcuts are disabled while an input, textarea, select, dialog, or content-editable element owns focus unless explicitly relevant. The component library renders these as buttons carrying roles rather than as native tags, so the guard is on the `dialog`, `alertdialog`, `combobox`, `listbox`, and `menu` roles as well as on tag names (DEC-029).
- `0` means score 10 only in score-shortcut context; Escape cancels an edit.
- Virtual rows have stable keys and fixed measured sizes. Sort/filter changes crossfade the container; rows do not use layout animations.
- Both list densities are `role="feed"` with `article` children carrying `aria-posinset`/`aria-setsize` from the server-side total, and the feed sets `aria-busy` while a page is loading. Neither is an ARIA table: they have no column headers and no cells, and claiming otherwise produced a structure screen readers could not navigate (DEC-038).
- The library grid virtualizes rows of cards, not single entries. The column count is derived from the measured container width so no card falls below its minimum width; a virtual row is one fixed-height band of that many fixed-height cards. Mounted DOM is therefore bounded per row and per card, and both bounds are asserted.
- **The library virtualizes against the window, not against a scroll container of its own.** The primary surface uses the whole page, so the list element has no height and no overflow, and the virtualizer is given a `scroll margin` for what sits above it. The mounted-DOM bounds are unchanged by this and are re-asserted at 10,000 entries against the window; `/triage` keeps its own fixed-height container, where a dense working table inside a page is the intent.
- A library card is a fixed box: fixed-size cover, clamped metadata, and a control row that never wraps. Controls that expand (the compact score picker) render as an overlay anchored inside the card, so expanding a control never changes a card's layout box or paints into a neighbor.
- Two components are deliberately bespoke rather than library primitives, and must stay that way (DEC-026). The score picker may not become a portalled primitive, because its expanded panel is required to remain geometrically inside its card; portalling to `document.body` breaks that by construction. The library card box may not adopt a primitive carrying its own intrinsic padding, because the card height is pinned for fixed-size virtualization and the column calculation subtracts a matched row padding.
- Every user action produces visible feedback. Feedback rendered only into a visually hidden element is a defect, not an implementation. The visible surface carries the accessible announcement rather than sitting beside a second, duplicate live region (DEC-028): a confirmation is announced once and seen once.
- Selection is independent of mounted rows: either explicit selected IDs or `all_matching=true` with excluded IDs. `Ctrl/Cmd+A` means all server rows matching the current filter, not merely loaded rows.

The product spec defines each screen. Sprint acceptance tests must include the critical keyboard flows and reduced-motion behavior.

## 9. Security and data safety

Although LAN-only, treat all imports, provider payloads, images, query parameters, and notes as untrusted.

- Parameterized SQL only; whitelist sort expressions.
- Escape rendered text; do not render provider descriptions as raw HTML without sanitization.
- Limit uploads, decompression/image dimensions, provider response sizes, and request timeouts.
- Prevent path traversal and symlink escape for Calibre and staged files. For attachments this is structural rather than filtered: the stored path is the content digest and an uploaded filename is only ever metadata, so no caller-supplied string reaches the filesystem.
- **Serve attachments as downloads, never inline.** `Content-Disposition: attachment`, `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, and a fixed `application/octet-stream`. Attachments are the only user-controlled content type the application serves — everything else is re-encoded to JPEG by the cover pipeline — and the SPA shares their origin, so an uploaded HTML or SVG rendered inline would run against the application's own API.
- Enforce read-only Calibre mount in Compose and read-only SQLite URI/query mode in code.
- Do not log notes, import row contents, API keys, or full provider payloads.
- No CORS by default in the single-origin deployment.
- No auth means no public exposure. Documentation and Compose comments must state this prominently.

## 10. Testing and quality gates

Test pyramid:

- domain unit tests: ISBN armor/checksums/conversion-equivalence, accent normalization, merge/rank, edition-safe ambiguous matching, precedence/conflicts, status/score invariants, and cursor encode/filter/null/tie logic;
- repository/application integration tests against migrated temporary **file-backed** SQLite databases, covering WAL/foreign keys, concurrent identity races, import rollback/idempotency, existing-entry preservation, undo before/after user edits, stale-job recovery, pagination plans, and sort-key mutation reloads;
- provider/filesystem contract tests with mocked HTTP for concurrent partial failure, 429/timeout/malformed payloads, Open Library work/edition years, refresh complete/partial/failure, oversized/non-image covers, atomic rename, and path/read-only failures;
- import parser fixtures for BOM/quoted/malformed/realistic Goodreads exports and synthetic Calibre schema variants; verify source Calibre DB hashes never change;
- API tests through the ASGI app;
- frontend component tests for forms, optimistic rollback, keyboard guards, and accessibility;
- Playwright tests for add-manual, edit-score, import-preview/commit/triage, and critical navigation;
- container smoke test with persistent `/data`, read-only `/calibre`, readiness, and SPA fallback.

`make check` must format-check, lint, type-check, validate docs/state, and verify generated API types. `make test` must run deterministic unit/integration/component tests. Network-dependent and live-provider smoke tests are opt-in and never gates for normal commits.

CI runs the Chromium Playwright suite as its own job. The layout and keyboard regressions are the only automated guardrail on the virtualization and grid contracts in section 8, and they are not part of `make test`. The same job runs the `@axe-core/playwright` checks in `e2e/accessibility.spec.ts`, which fail on any `serious` or `critical` WCAG 2.0/2.1 A/AA violation on every reachable screen, including the score-picker overlay open inside its card and a dialog open over detail (DEC-038). Lesser impacts are reported, not failed. Automated checks cover only what is computable from a rendered tree; the keyboard and focus checklist is walked by hand and recorded in the worklog.

Automated gates are necessary and not sufficient. A sprint touching user-visible behavior additionally requires the walkthrough gate in `AGENTS.md` section 3: the application is run against realistic data, the sprint's flow is performed end to end, and the observations are recorded in the worklog. This requirement exists because thirteen sprints closed green on a product with an invisible feedback layer and a wholly failing enrichment pipeline (DEC-025).

Coverage is a diagnostic, not a target to game. Critical domain and import code should have branch coverage; acceptance criteria are behavior-based.

## 11. Observability and operations

Emit structured logs with timestamp, level, event name, request/job correlation ID, duration, and safe counters. Provider failures and job retries are warnings; exhausted jobs are errors. Never log secrets or personal notes, and do not rely on call sites to remember: `logging.py` redacts a denylist of keys (notes, review, description, payload, row/record, api_key, token and kin), scrubs configured secret values out of any string so a key embedded in a logged URL cannot escape, truncates oversized values under innocent keys, and recurses into nested structures. Standard-library records are routed through the same chain, so a `logger.warning(..., extra={...})` is rendered and redacted rather than having its structured fields silently dropped.

The final image runs as a non-root user (uid 10001), has a healthcheck, and receives signals directly; `STOPSIGNAL` is `SIGTERM` and uvicorn runs its own graceful shutdown, so a stop closes SQLite rather than killing it mid-write. Compose mounts, by default (DEC-075):

- `data:/data` — named volume, `AKASHA_DATA_VOLUME` overridable
- `backups:/backups` — named volume, `AKASHA_BACKUP_VOLUME` overridable
- `${CALIBRE_DIR:-./calibre}:/calibre:ro`

A fresh named volume is seeded from the image's own `/data`, `/backups` on first mount, ownership included, so there is nothing to `chown` from the host. Opting into `${DATA_DIR:-./data}:/data` and `${BACKUP_DIR:-./backups}:/backups` as real host directories instead is a second, explicitly invoked Compose file, `compose.bind-mounts.yaml`.

Backups live outside the data volume, not under `/data` (DEC-040): a copy kept inside the volume it protects is lost with that volume. `backup_dir` derives as a sibling of `data_dir`. The backup itself is `book_tracker.backup`, exposed as the `akasha-backup` console script and driven nightly from the host scheduler by `scripts/backup.sh` — the single application process is not a cron daemon. It copies the database through SQLite's online backup API and never file-by-file, archives covers and import audit metadata, writes a manifest and SHA-256 checksums, runs `PRAGMA integrity_check` on the copy, and enforces label-scoped retention. Restore verifies every checksum and the database before writing, and refuses a non-empty target. Nothing on the restore path imports the application, so restoring onto a bare machine needs no configuration.

Migrations run at startup, preceded by an online backup whenever revisions are pending against an existing database; startup fails rather than migrating without one, and the backup is taken once per revision rather than once per restart attempt (DEC-039). Deployment docs cover migration, rollback, backup, restore, and LAN-only proxy guidance in `docs/operations/runbook.md`.

## 12. Deferred decisions and explicit defaults

Defaults adopted until the owner changes them:

1. `unsorted` is searchable and appears when explicitly filtered or through shelf views, but is excluded from `/` by default.
2. Entry deletion retains orphaned items/covers; no v1 prune action.
3. One item is one edition; rereads of another edition remain represented lossily by the same entry and incremented `reread_count`.
4. Series remains free text in metadata.

Deferred to v2+: export, authentication, sharing, multiuser UI, Calibre write-back, OPDS, and new item domains. Agents must not implement these as speculative infrastructure.
