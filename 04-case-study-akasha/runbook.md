# Operator runbook

Everything here has been performed against a running container, not written from
the source. Commands assume the repository checked out on the host and `docker`
with the Compose plugin installed; nothing else is needed.

**Akasha v1 has no authentication.** Anyone who can reach the port can read and
change every rating, note and shelf. Keep it on a trusted LAN.

## First install

```bash
cp .env.example .env      # then edit it
mkdir -p calibre
docker compose up -d
```

`USER_AGENT_CONTACT` is required and startup refuses without it: Open Library
asks callers to identify themselves. `GOOGLE_BOOKS_API_KEY` is optional; without
it search runs on Open Library alone and Spanish-language coverage is poor.

`data` and `backups` are named Docker volumes by default (DEC-075), seeded from
the image with the right ownership already on them — there is nothing to `chown`.
Want either as a real host directory instead (a NAS-backed `BACKUP_DIR`, direct
host access to the sqlite file)? See "Bind-mounting data and backups" below.

Check it came up:

```bash
docker compose ps                     # State should be "healthy"
curl -fsS http://localhost:8000/api/health/ready
```

## Upgrading

```bash
git pull
docker compose up -d --build
```

Migrations run automatically at startup, and startup takes an online backup
first whenever there are pending revisions (DEC-039). That copy lands in
`/backups/pre-migration-<timestamp>/` and is **never** removed by nightly
retention, because it is the rollback point for that upgrade. If the backup
cannot be written the application refuses to migrate and exits, which is
deliberate: an unprotected schema rewrite on a database full of your own ratings
is worse than downtime.

Migration `0007` rewrites every row in `items`. On a library of a few thousand
books it takes well under a second; the log line to look for is
`pre_migration_backup_written`.

## Rolling back

Alembic here is forward-only, so a rollback is a restore plus an older image.

Docker has no way to rename a volume, so this restores into a fresh one and
flips which volume Compose points at, rather than swapping directories on the
host. The volume `data` is currently attached to is left untouched — it's the
rollback point for the rollback, if this ever needs undoing.

```bash
docker compose down
docker run --rm -v akasha_backups:/backups:ro alpine ls /backups   # find the pre-migration copy
docker volume create akasha_data_rollback
docker run --rm --user 10001 \
  -v akasha_backups:/backups:ro -v akasha_data_rollback:/data \
  akasha:local akasha-backup restore /backups/pre-migration-<stamp> --into /data
echo "AKASHA_DATA_VOLUME=akasha_data_rollback" >> .env
git checkout <previous-tag-or-commit> && docker compose up -d --build
```

On `compose.bind-mounts.yaml` (a real `backups/` directory), replace both
`-v akasha_backups:/backups:ro` above with `-v "$PWD/backups:/backups:ro"`, and
`ls backups/` works directly — `akasha-backup restore` itself doesn't care
which kind of mount either side is.

Restore refuses to write into a directory that is not empty, so it cannot
silently overwrite a database you meant to keep. To undo the rollback later,
remove the `AKASHA_DATA_VOLUME` line from `.env` and `docker compose up -d`
again — the volume it names is still there, untouched.

## Nightly backups

Schedule from the host, not from inside the container — the application is one
process and is not a cron daemon.

```cron
15 3 * * *  cd /srv/akasha && ./scripts/backup.sh >> /var/log/akasha-backup.log 2>&1
```

`scripts/backup.sh` requires the stack to be running: an online backup reads a
live database through SQLite's backup API rather than copying a WAL file out
from under a writer. Each run writes a directory containing `books.db`,
`covers.tar.gz`, `imports.tar.gz`, `manifest.json` and `checksums.sha256`,
verifies its own output with `PRAGMA integrity_check`, and then deletes the
oldest `nightly-` backups beyond `BACKUP_RETENTION` (default 7).

Attached files are carried as **hardlinks**, in an `attachments/` directory
alongside the tarballs, and the manifest lists each blob's digest and size.
They are not tarred and not compressed: an epub is already a ZIP, so gzip
measured a ratio of 1.0003 on them while costing ten times the runtime, and a
tar shares no bytes with the one written the night before (DEC-047). Sharing is
why seven nights of attachments cost about one copy instead of seven. Deleting
an expired backup only decrements a link count, so it can never take a blob
another backup still needs — and a backup keeps an attachment recoverable after
you delete it from the library, which is the point of having one.

If `BACKUP_DIR` is on a different filesystem from the data volume — which is the
normal Compose setup — blobs are linked from the previous backup instead, so
sharing still holds. A copy is only paid on the very first backup to a fresh
disk.

Backups live on their own mount, outside the data volume (DEC-040). Point
`BACKUP_DIR` at a NAS share if you have one; a backup on the same disk as the
database does not survive losing that disk.

Check one by hand at any time:

```bash
docker compose exec akasha akasha-backup verify /backups/nightly-<stamp>
```

## Reclaiming attachment space

A blob whose last row goes away is removed with it. A few routes leave one behind
anyway — an item deleted outside the application, a crash between writing the file
and recording the row — and nothing else collects those. This finds them:

```bash
docker compose exec akasha akasha-attachments reclaim
```

It **reports and removes nothing** by default: what it would delete, what it kept
because a row still points at it, and anything under `attachments/` it did not
put there and will not touch. Read that list, then run it again to act on it:

```bash
docker compose exec akasha akasha-attachments reclaim --apply
```

Safe to run at any time, including while the stack is serving. A blob written in
the last hour is never touched, which is what keeps it away from an upload whose
file has landed but whose database row has not been committed yet; pass
`--grace-seconds` if you ever need to narrow that window. A blob a backup has
linked survives this — the backup holds its own reference to the same inode, so
reclaiming the live copy cannot reach the bytes.

There is no schedule for it and it deliberately does not run itself. It deletes
by inference, and inference belongs behind a person.

## Restoring

As with a rollback, this restores into a fresh volume and flips which one
Compose points at, rather than swapping directories on the host — the volume
`data` is currently attached to is left alone.

```bash
docker compose down
docker volume create akasha_data_restored
docker run --rm --user 10001 \
  -v akasha_backups:/backups:ro -v akasha_data_restored:/data \
  akasha:local akasha-backup restore /backups/nightly-<stamp> --into /data
echo "AKASHA_DATA_VOLUME=akasha_data_restored" >> .env
docker compose up -d
```

On `compose.bind-mounts.yaml`, replace `-v akasha_backups:/backups:ro` above
with `-v "$PWD/backups:/backups:ro"` — `akasha-backup restore` doesn't care
which kind of mount either side is.

Restore verifies every checksum and re-runs `integrity_check` before writing
anything. It needs no configuration at all — not even `USER_AGENT_CONTACT` —
because the restore path deliberately does not build the application. To go
back, remove the `AKASHA_DATA_VOLUME` line from `.env` and `docker compose up
-d` again — the old volume is still there.

### Bind-mounting data and backups

Prefer `./data` and `./backups` as real host directories — a NAS-backed
`BACKUP_DIR`, direct host access to the sqlite file? Opt into
`compose.bind-mounts.yaml`, which brings back the pre-DEC-075 mounts and their
one extra requirement:

```bash
mkdir -p data backups
sudo chown -R 10001:10001 data backups   # the container runs as uid 10001
docker compose -f compose.yaml -f compose.bind-mounts.yaml up -d
```

Use the same two `-f` flags on every subsequent `docker compose` command for
this stack — upgrades, `down`, `logs`, all of it.

## Reverse proxy

Nginx Proxy Manager on the same LAN, e.g. `books.home.lan` → `http://<host>:8000`.
Do not expose that hostname beyond the LAN, do not forward a port to it, and do
not put it behind a proxy that terminates on a public address. There is no login
to stop anyone who arrives.

Set `AKASHA_BIND=127.0.0.1` if the proxy runs on the same machine, so the
container port is not reachable from the network directly.

## When something is wrong

| Symptom | Cause |
|---|---|
| `attempt to write a readonly database` | on `compose.bind-mounts.yaml` only: `data/` is not owned by 10001 |
| Startup exits with `Refusing to migrate without a backup` | on `compose.bind-mounts.yaml` only: `backups/` is missing or not owned by 10001 |
| `/api/health/ready` returns 503 `schema_not_current` | migrations have not finished, or failed; check the logs |
| Search finds nothing and the UI says degraded | no `GOOGLE_BOOKS_API_KEY`, or no outbound network |
| The backup script says the service is not running | start the stack; an online backup needs a live database |

On the default named-volume mounts, neither ownership row above is reachable —
there's no host directory to get wrong.

Logs are JSON, one object per line: `docker compose logs -f akasha`. Notes,
review text, import rows and API keys are redacted before they are written.
